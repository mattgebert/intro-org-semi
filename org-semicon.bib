	abstract = {We discuss how the emission of electrons and ions during electron-beam-induced physical vapor deposition can cause problems in micro- and nanofabrication processes. After giving a short overview of different types of radiation emitted from an electron-beam (e-beam) evaporator and how the amount of radiation depends on different deposition parameters and conditions, we highlight two phenomena in more detail: First, we discuss an unintentional shadow evaporation beneath the undercut of a resist layer caused by the one part of the metal vapor which got ionized by electron-impact ionization. These ions first lead to an unintentional build-up of charges on the sample, which in turn results in an electrostatic deflection of subsequently incoming ionized metal atoms toward the undercut of the resist. Second, we show how low-energy secondary electrons during the metallization process can cause cross-linking, blisters, and bubbles in the respective resist layer used for defining micro- and nanostructures in an e-beam lithography process. After the metal deposition, the cross-linked resist may lead to significant problems in the lift-off process and causes leftover residues on the device. We provide a troubleshooting guide on how to minimize these effects, which e.g. includes the correct alignment of the e-beam, the avoidance of contaminations in the crucible and, most importantly, the installation of deflector electrodes within the evaporation chamber.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses that building in an electric field, effective fields, or both does the creation of the symmetry-breaking region. The diffusion is relatively unimportant in charge separation and photovoltaic action. It can be very important in charge collection. The mathematical system of equations describing the physics of solar cells shows the presence of an electric field, the presence of effective force fields, and diffusion, as the three possible causes of photovoltaic action. There are absorbers with absorption and collection lengths both in the nano-scale, absorption lengths in the microscale and collection lengths in the nano-scale, and absorption and collection lengths both in the microscale. This chapter assesses the impact of effective force fields on photovoltaic action, one needs to create a structure in which there is no built-in electric field in TE but there is an effective force field for electrons, holes, or both. All three sources of photovoltaic action may exist simultaneously in a structure, but built-in electric field and effective fields are the major sources.},

	abstract = {Observations of novel quantum phenomena expected for three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) often require fabrications of thin-film devices and tuning of the Fermi level across the Dirac point. Since thin films have both top and bottom surfaces, an effective control of the surface chemical potential requires dual gating. However, a reliable dual-gating technique for TI thin films has not yet been developed. Here we report a comprehensive method to fabricate a dual-gated TI device and demonstrate tuning of the chemical potential of both surfaces across the Dirac points. The most important part of our method is the recipe for safely detaching high-quality, bulk-insulating (Bi1–xSbx)2Te3 thin films from sapphire substrates and transferring them to Si/SiO2 wafers that allow back gating. Fabrication of an efficient top gate by low-temperature deposition of a SiNx dielectric complements the procedure. Our dual-gated devices are shown to be effective in tuning the chemical potential in a wide range encompassing the Dirac points on both surfaces.},

However, such a process produces only microsized flakes that are highly irregular in shape and thickness. In this work, we developed a process to transfer the entire area of TI Bi2Se3 thin films grown epitaxially on Al2O3 and SiO2 to arbitrary substrates, maintaining their pristine morphology and crystallinity. Transport measurements show that these transferred films have lower carrier concentrations and comparable or higher mobilities than before the transfer. Furthermore, using this process we demonstrated a clear metal–insulator transition in an ultrathin Bi2Se3 film by gate-tuning its Fermi level into the hybridization gap formed at the Dirac point. The ability to transfer large area TI films to any substrate will facilitate fabrication of TI heterostructure devices, which will help explore exotic phenomena such as Majorana fermions and topological magnetoelectricity.},

	abstract = {As in any discipline, understanding the underlying scientific principles has profound practical implications when properly understood. In this series of articles, we will review the first principles of vacuum technology and explain them using real-world illustrations. Most industrial vacuum systems can, in broad-based terms, be categorized in terms of low (i.e., “soft”), medium, high (i.e., “hard”) and ultra-high vacuum. These ranges are very useful in describing the various pressure, flow, and other phenomenon encountered, which leads to a better understanding of vacuum pump selection and operation, and system operational requirements at the different vacuum levels. As shown by the difference in pressure from low to ultra-high vacuum, industrial vacuum systems must operate under an extremely wide range of pressure. In fact, the range is so large it is hard to actually comprehend. Consider a volume of gas at a pressure of 1000 mbar (atmospheric pressure) in a 1 meter by 1 meter by 1 meter container sealed so that no molecules can escape or enter. It is easy to understand that if the container is expanded in volume while still remaining sealed, the pressure will decrease (and a vacuum will be created) in direct proportion to the increase in volume (in accordance with Boyle's law). If, for example, the container volume is doubled to 2 cubic meters, the pressure will decrease by half, to 500 mbar. When this relationship is expanded to the scale of industrial vacuum systems, the result is striking. If we take this same 1 cubic meter volume of gas and increase its volume sufficiently for the pressure to be reduced to 10-12 mbar (ultra-high vacuum), the container will be a staggering 99 km long x 99 km wide x 99 km high, or 200 times the volume of the grand canyon!},

Among them, 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), a star family member, have already been explored over the last few years and have exhibited excellent performance in electronics, catalysis, and other related fields. However, to fulfill the requirement for practical application, the batch production of 2D TMDs is essential. Recently, the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique was considered as an elegant alternative for successfully growing 2D TMDs and their heterostructures. The latest research advances in the controllable synthesis of 2D TMDs and related heterostructures/superlattices via the CVD approach are illustrated here. The controlled growth behavior, preparation strategies, and breakthroughs on the synthesis of new 2D TMDs and their heterostructures, as well as their unique physical phenomena, are also discussed. Recent progress on the application of CVD-grown 2D materials is revealed with particular attention to electronics/optoelectronic devices and catalysts. Finally, the challenges and future prospects are considered regarding the current development of 2D TMDs and related heterostructures.},

We extract these metallic crystals from the liquid metal solvent by reducing its surface tension using a combination of electrocapillary modulation and vacuum filtration. The liquid metal–grown crystals feature high morphological diversity and persistent symmetry. The concept is expanded to other single and binary metal solutes and Ga-based solvents, with the growth mechanisms elucidated through ab initio simulation of interfacial stability. This strategy offers general routes for creating highly crystalline, shape-controlled metallic or multimetallic fine structures from liquid metal solvents.},

This PVC-MDP structure enables us to achieve small and adjustable contact areas between the PVC-MDP and a 2D-material flake, which is typically between ∼10 and ∼100 μm in diameter. The adhesion between the PVC polymer and 2D materials is fully tunable with temperature: Strong adhesion at ∼70 °C allows pick-up of the 2D material, and release occurs at ∼130 °C when the adhesion is weak. Thus the PVC-MDP functions as a point-of-contact manipulator for 2D materials, permitting the 3D manipulation of 2D-material flakes.

The present calculations explain the trend exhibited by the surface energies of the alkali, alkaline earth, divalent rare-earth, 3d, 4d, and 5d transition and noble metals, as derived from the surface tension of liquid metals. In addition, they give work functions which agree with the limited experimental data obtained from single crystals to within 15\%, and explain the smooth behavior of the experimental work functions of polycrystalline samples as a function of atomic number. It is argued that the surface energies and work functions calculated by present day ab initio methods are at least as accurate as the experimental values.},

Micromilling is one of the micromachining methods which has been extensively used to manufacture polymer components. In this study, a high-speed micromilling method was used to manufacture polymer with high form accuracy and surface quality. The processing temperature effects on the surface quality were investigated in detail. The dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) experiment was used to study the material mechanical property under different temperatures. According to the DMA results, the PMMA sample is in the glass and viscoelastic state during the milling process. The cutting chips under various processing temperatures are classified into three kinds according to their shapes: roll, sheet, and sinter. The surface roughness of samples with sheet and roll cutting chips is smaller than that of sinter cutting chips. To obtain a better machining bottom surface and edge shape, the processing temperature below 70 °C is recommended according to the results.

	abstract = {We demonstrated an all-dry polymer-to-polymer transfer technique for two-dimensional (2D) crystal flakes using a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) layer deposited on a piece of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Unexpectedly, the pickup/release temperatures were modified in wider temperature range simply by changing the thickness of the PVC layer than changing the plasticizer ratio. Utilizing the difference in the pickup/release temperatures depending on the PVC film thickness, 2D flakes were transferred from a thicker PVC film to a thinner one. This polymer-to-polymer transfer technique can be utilized to flip over van der Waals heterostructures. As a demonstration, we fabricated a mountain-like stacked structure of hexagonal boron nitride flakes using the flip-over stacking technique. Finally, we compared the results of thermomechanical analysis with the pickup/release temperatures of the PVC/PDMS stamp. The PVC was revealed to be at the glass transition and in the viscoelastic flow regimes when the 2D flakes were picked up and dry released, respectively. Our polymer-to-polymer transfer method facilitates flip-over van der Waals stacking in an all-dry manner, expanding the possibility of 2D materials device fabrications.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate the dry release transfer of single-layer and bi-layer graphene and few-layer h-BN by utilizing poly(propylene) carbonate (PPC) films. Because of the strong adhesion between PPC and 2D materials around room temperature, we demonstrate that single-layer to few-layer graphene, as well as few-layer h-BN can be fabricated on a spin-coated PPC film/SiO2/Si substrate via the mechanical exfoliation method. In addition, we show that these single-layer to few-layer crystals are clearly distinguishable using an optical microscope with the help of optical interference. Because of the thermoplastic properties of PPC film, the adhesion between the 2D materials and PPC significantly decreases at about 70 °C. Therefore, by tuning the temperature, the graphene and h-BN flakes on PPC can be easily dry-transferred onto another h-BN substrate. We demonstrate the fabrication of encapsulated h-BN/graphene/h-BN devices and graphene/few-layer h-BN/graphene vertical-tunnel-junction devices using this method. Our finding provides a simple method for constructing high-quality graphene and h-BN-based van der Waals heterostructures with a minimum amount of polymer contamination.},

              The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect combines topology and magnetism to produce precisely quantized Hall resistance at zero magnetic field. We report the observation of a QAH effect in twisted bilayer graphene aligned to hexagonal boron nitride. The effect is driven by intrinsic strong interactions, which polarize the electrons into a single spin- and valley-resolved moiré miniband with Chern number
              C
              = 1. In contrast to magnetically doped systems, the measured transport energy gap is larger than the Curie temperature for magnetic ordering, and quantization to within 0.1\% of the von Klitzing constant persists to temperatures of several kelvin at zero magnetic field. Electrical currents as small as 1 nanoampere controllably switch the magnetic order between states of opposite polarization, forming an electrically rewritable magnetic memory.},

	abstract = {A quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator is characterized by quantized Hall and vanishing longitudinal resistances at zero magnetic ﬁeld that are protected against local perturbations and independent of sample details [1, 2, 3]. This insensitivity makes the microscopic details of the local current distribution inaccessible to global transport measurements. Accordingly, the current distributions that give rise to the transport quantization are unknown. Here we use magnetic imaging to directly visualize the transport current in the QAH regime. As we tune through the QAH plateau by electrostatic gating, we clearly identify a regime in which the sample transports current primarily in the bulk rather than along the edges. Furthermore, we image the local response of the magnetization to electrostatic gating. Combined, these measurements suggest that incompressible regions carry the current within the QAH regime. Our observations indicate that the self-consistent electrostatics of the sample play a central role in determining the current distribution. Identifying the appropriate microscopic picture of electronic transport in QAH insulators and other topologically non-trivial states of matter is a crucial step towards realizing their potential in next-generation quantum devices [4, 5].},

We identify bulk conduction as the dominant source of dissipation at all values of temperature and in-plane electric field. Furthermore, we observe identical breakdown phenomenology in both geometries, indicating that breakdown of the QAH phase is a bulk process. The methodology developed in this study could be used to identify dissipative conduction mechanisms in new QAH materials, ultimately guiding material development toward realization of the QAH effect at higher temperatures.},

In particular, quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators feature topological boundary currents whose chirality is determined by the magnetization orientation.

Our images reveal a dramatic change in the edge state structure and an unexpected microwave response at the topological phase transition between the Chern number

The non-equilibrium magnon population established at the interface can decay in part by interactions of magnons with electrons near the Fermi energy of the topological insulator. When this decay channel is made active by tuning (BixSb1−x)2Te3 into a bulk insulator, a large electromotive force emerges in the direction perpendicular to the in-plane magnetization of yttrium iron garnet. The enhanced, tunable SSE which occurs when the Fermi level lies in the bulk gap offers unique advantages over the usual SSE in metals and therefore opens up exciting possibilities in spintronics.},

These materials are bulk semiconductors but host protected metallic surface states. As shown in the cover artwork, the spins of the electrons in these states are locked orthogonally to their propagation direction. Specific symmetries of the electronic band structure allow dissipation-free electron and information transport. Therefore, they are envisioned as promising candidates in the development of high-performance spin field-effect transistors and quantum bits. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M.

	abstract = {Topological surface states protected by mirror symmetry are of interest for spintronic applications. Such states were predicted to exist in the rocksalt IV–VI semiconductors, and several groups have observed the surface states in (Pb,Sn)Te, (Pb,Sn)Se and SnTe using photoemission. An underlying assumption in the theory is that the surface states arise from bulk states describable as massive Dirac states, but this assumption is untested. Here we show that the thermoelectric response of the bulk states displays features specific to the Dirac spectrum. By relating the carrier density to the peaks in the quantum oscillations, we show that the first (N=0) Landau level is non-degenerate. This finding provides robust evidence that the bulk states are indeed massive Dirac states. In the lowest Landau level, Sxx displays a striking linear increase versus magnetic field characteristic of massive Dirac fermions. In addition, the Nernst signal displays a sign anomaly in the gap-inverted phase at low temperatures.},

After that, the thin-films were post-annealed in air at temperatures higher than 650 degrees Celsius for 3 hours to be crystallized. In the XRD diagrams, large diffraction peaks from only YIG ferrite (444) or (888) plane were observed in the samples post-annealed at over 1050 degrees Celsius. The half value width (Δθ50) in the rocking curve for YIG ferrite (888) was as small as 0.13 degrees. These results proved that the YIG ferrite films have been grown in hetero-epitaxial manner on GGG (111) substrate with high orientation. The YIG ferrite thin-films had reasonable saturation magnetization of 1.7 kG, relatively low coercivity of less than 5 Oe and small ΔH of around 70 Oe. The YIG ferrite thin-films are useful for microwave magnetic devices. (© 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) measurements have been performed on target and post-annealed film. The saturation magnetization (Ms) of film and target varied abruptly. There is an induced magneto crystalline anisotropy in YIG single crystalline thin film. On the other hand the bulk target doesn’t have any type of magneto crystalline anisotropy. Due to this induced anisotropy and single crystalline nature of YIG thin film, it shows a very narrow FMR line width (25 Gauss) and simultaneously very low Gilbert damping constant (5×10-4). Bulk target have a very broad FMR linewidth (850 Gauss) due to larger number of magnetic domains and defects. YIG thin film grown on GGG substrate shows very low damping and hence can be used for magnonics and narrow band microwave filters.},

The effective saturation magnetization (4πMeff), obtained from Ferromagnetic Resonance at room temperature, is found to be 2600 G, which is higher than SQUID measured 4πMS value of 1770 G. This implies that the value of 4πMeff can only be accounted by considering a negative anisotropy field (HU) of around 830 Oe at room temperature. Such an anisotropy is attributed to a compressive stress (−1.70 × 1010 dyne/cm2) induced in the film closer to the film-air interface. The presence of this stress in YIG film was confirmed using multiple \{hkl\} stress measurements with grazing incidence X-ray diffraction performed at different depth of penetration on the YIG film.},

A mixing ratio of Bi2Se3 to Bi2Te3 was controlled by varying the Bi:Te:Se flux ratio. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy measurements indicate the high crystalline quality for the as-grown Bi2Te3−xSex films. Substitution of Te by Se is also revealed from both analyses. The surfaces of the films exhibit terrace-like quintuple layers and their size of the characteristic triangular terraces decreases monotonically with increasing Se content. However, the triangular terrace structure gradually recovers as the Se content further increases. Most importantly, the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results provide evidence of single-Dirac-cone like surface states in which Bi2Te3−xSex with Se/Te-substitution leads to tunable surface states. Our results demonstrate that by fine-tuned MBE growth conditions, Bi2Te3−xSex thin film alloys with tunable topological surface states can be obtained, providing an excellent platform for exploring the novel device applications based on this compound.},

Under broken time-reversal symmetry, the single Dirac cone is predicted to cause half-integer quantization of Hall conductance, which is a manifestation of the parity anomaly in quantum field theory1–9. However, despite various observations of quantization phenomena10–15, the half-integer quantization has not been observed because most experiments simultaneously measure a pair of equivalent Dirac cones16 on two opposing surfaces. Here we demonstrate the half-integer quantization of Hall conductance in a synthetic heterostructure termed a semi-magnetic topological insulator, where only one surface state is gapped by magnetic doping and the opposite one is non-magnetic and gapless. We observe half-quantized Faraday and Kerr rotations with terahertz magneto-optical spectroscopy and half-quantized Hall conductance in transport at zero magnetic field. Our results suggest a condensed-matter realization of the parity anomaly4–9 and open a way for studying the physics enabled by a single Dirac fermion.},

From the variation of the energy separation of the vHs with the rotation angle we are able to recover the Fermi velocity of a graphene monolayer as well as the strength of the interlayer interaction. The robustness of the vHs is assessed both by experiments, which show that they survive in the presence of a third graphene layer, and by calculations, which test the role of the periodic modulation and absolute value of the interlayer distance. Finally, we clarify the role of the layer topographic corrugation and of electronic effects in the apparent moiré contrast measured on the STM images.},

The Seebeck coefficient is calculated using this model, which gives good agreement with the experiment. We conclude that the good thermoelectric property originates from this “corrugated flat band”, where the coexistence of large Seebeck coefficient and large electric conductivity is generally expected.},

	abstract = {Improving the performance of thermoelectric materials for clean energy production via structural manipulation is considered as an effective route to advanced thermoelectrics. Here, we report the improved thermoelectric response of single-layered GeS (α-GeS) by developing its two new polymorphs, namely, γ-GeS and ε-GeS. The two new polymorphs exhibited flat-band gap edges, which resulted in large Seebeck coefficients (thermopowers) due to the large density of states around the Fermi level. The favorable combination of large thermopowers and considerable electrical conductivities resulted in large values of thermoelectric power factors (PFs) and thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT). The room-temperature ZT values of γ-GeS and ε-GeS exceeded a benchmark value of unity and approached as large as 1.67 (for γ-GeS at 500 K) and 1.07 (for ε-GeS at 1000 K). These monolayers demonstrated large PFs corresponding to band gap edges that can be enhanced by low-level p-type doping. Moreover, their optimal PFs go through further enhancement with increase in temperature. The investigations of energetic stability revealed high thermodynamic stability of these monolayers, which suggest the feasibility of their experimental growth. These investigations were performed through the density functional theory and Boltzmann transport theory-based computational approaches. Our study suggests structural manipulation as an effective tool for improvement of the thermoelectric response of IV monochalcogenides for high-efficiency thermoelectric applications.},

However, the artisanal assembly of structures from micromechanically exfoliated flakes3,4 is not compatible with scalable and rapid manufacturing. Further engineering of vdW solids requires precisely designed and controlled composition over all three spatial dimensions and interlayer rotation. Here, we report a robotic four-dimensional pixel assembly method for manufacturing vdW solids with unprecedented speed, deliberate design, large area and angle control. We used the robotic assembly of prepatterned ‘pixels’ made from atomically thin two-dimensional components. Wafer-scale two-dimensional material films were grown, patterned through a clean, contact-free process and assembled using engineered adhesive stamps actuated by a high-vacuum robot. We fabricated vdW solids with up to 80 individual layers, consisting of 100 × 100 μm2 areas with predesigned patterned shapes, laterally/vertically programmed composition and controlled interlayer angle. This enabled efficient optical spectroscopic assays of the vdW solids, revealing new excitonic and absorbance layer dependencies in MoS2. Furthermore, we fabricated twisted N-layer assemblies, where we observed atomic reconstruction of twisted four-layer WS2 at high interlayer twist angles of ≥4°. Our method enables the rapid manufacturing of atomically resolved quantum materials, which could help realize the full potential of vdW heterostructures as a platform for novel physics2,5,6 and advanced electronic technologies7,8.},

	abstract = {In this work, thermoelectric (TE) properties of monolayer InClSe are investigated by using the first-principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport theory, which is a novel member of FeOCl-type 2D materials. We find that the electronic and thermal transport parameters along x and y axis are quite different, resulting in a strong anisotropic thermoelectric performance of monolayer InClSe, which provides a possibility to design anisotropic thermoelectric device. For n-type doping, monolayer InClSe has high electrical conductivity along x-axis. Detailed calculations reveal that the high electrical conductivity is originate from the long electron relaxation time and high connectivity of electron conduction channels. The high electrical conductivity and satisfactory Seebeck coefficient result in the excellent power factor (PF) for monolayer InClSe. For n-type doping, the optimal PF along x-axis can reach 47.8 mW m−1 K−2 at 700 K, which is much higher than most typical thermoelectric materials. Combining excellent PF and suppressed lattice thermal conductivity, the n-type doping monolayer InClSe has high ZT values in wide temperature range (300 K–700 K) along x-axis and the maximal ZT value reaches 2.82 at 700 K. Our results demonstrate that monolayer InClSe is a promising thermoelectric candidate for energy harvesting in moderate-temperature range.},

ZT can be highly enhanced from 0.17 to 1.1 by more than six times around 350 K under a perpendicular magnetic field of 7 T. The huge enhancement of ZT by magnetic field arises from the linear Dirac band with large Fermi velocity and the large electric thermal conductivity in Cd3As2.

For the efficient data-driven discovery of novel thermoelectric materials, we constructed a public dataset that contains experimentally synthesized thermoelectric materials and their experimental thermoelectric properties. For the collected dataset, we were able to construct prediction models that achieved R2-scores greater than 0.9 in the regression problems to predict the experimentally measured thermoelectric properties from the chemical compositions of the materials. Furthermore, we devised a material descriptor for the chemical compositions of the materials to improve the extrapolation capabilities of machine learning methods. Based on transfer learning with the proposed material descriptor, we significantly improved the R2-score from 0.13 to 0.71 in predicting experimental ZTs of the materials from completely unexplored material groups.},

It involves primarily three parameters, namely the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity. However, there are many other interrelated parameters, such as carrier concentration, mobility, effective mass, multi-valley bands, relaxation time, reduced Fermi energy, phonon modes, scattering parameters, and the number of neighbouring atoms in a given structure. The understanding of these parameters is equally important in order to optimize a high figure of merit (ZT). This article addresses the basics of electronic and thermal transport with the help of Boltzmann transport equation, fundamental concepts for the design of thermoelectric (TE) materials, and implementation of several strategies such as alloying, the phonon-glass electron-crystal (PGEC) approach, band engineering and nanostructuring to optimize the ZT of materials, and finally ends with a discussion of the future prospects of heat extraction through different heat sources.},

In this review, we aim to comprehensively summarize the state-of-the-art strategies for the realization of high-performance thermoelectric materials and devices by establishing the links between synthesis, structural characteristics, properties, underlying chemistry and physics, including structural design (point defects, dislocations, interfaces, inclusions, and pores), multidimensional design (quantum dots/wires, nanoparticles, nanowires, nano- or microbelts, few-layered nanosheets, nano- or microplates, thin films, single crystals, and polycrystalline bulks), and advanced device design (thermoelectric modules, miniature generators and coolers, and flexible thermoelectric generators). The outline of each strategy starts with a concise presentation of their fundamentals and carefully selected examples. In the end, we point out the controversies, challenges, and outlooks toward the future development of thermoelectric materials and devices. Overall, this review will serve to help materials scientists, chemists, and physicists, particularly students and young researchers, in selecting suitable strategies for the improvement of thermoelectrics and potentially other relevant energy conversion technologies.},

	abstract = {Since the first-generation three-dimensional topological insulators were discovered in classic thermoelectric systems, the exploration of novel topological materials for advanced thermoelectric energy conversion has attracted increasing attention. The rapid developments in the field of topological materials, from topological (crystalline) insulators, Dirac/Weyl semimetals, to magnetic Weyl semimetals, have offered a variety of exotic electronic structures, for example, topological surface states, linear Dirac/Weyl bands, and large Berry curvature. These topological electronic structures provide a fertile ground to advance different kinds of thermoelectric energy conversion based on the Seebeck effect, magneto-Seebeck effect, Nernst effect, and anomalous Nernst effect. In this Perspective, we present a vision for the development of different topological materials for various thermoelectric energy conversion applications based on their specific topological electronic structures. Recent theoretical calculations and experimental works have been summarized to demonstrate practical routes for this new field. Further outlook on scientific and technological challenges and opportunities with regard to topological thermoelectrics are offered.},

Here we demonstrate a thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of 2.5 at 923 K by the cumulative integration of several performance-enhancing concepts in a single material system. Using non-equilibrium processing we show that hole-doped samples of PbTe can be heavily alloyed with SrTe well beyond its thermodynamic solubility limit of {\textless}1 mol\%. The much higher levels of Sr alloyed into the PbTe matrix widen the bandgap and create convergence of the two valence bands of PbTe, greatly boosting the power factors with maximal values over 30 μW cm−1 K−2. Exceeding the 5 mol\% solubility limit leads to endotaxial SrTe nanostructures which produce extremely low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.5 W m−1 K−1 but preserve high hole mobilities because of the matrix/precipitate valence band alignment. The best composition is hole-doped PbTe–8\%SrTe.},

To answer that question, we write the electrical conductivity, thermopower, and thermal conductivity as integrals of a single function, the transport distribution. Then we derive the mathematical function for the transport distribution, which gives the largest figure of merit. A delta-shaped transport distribution is found to maximize the thermoelectric properties. This result indicates that a narrow distribution of the energy of the electrons participating in the transport process is needed for maximum thermoelectric efficiency. Some possible realizations of this idea are discussed.},

	abstract = {Thermoelectric materials are of interest for applications as heat pumps and power generators. The performance of thermoelectric devices is quantified by a figure of merit, ZT, where Z is a measure of a material's thermoelectric properties and T is the absolute temperature. A material with a figure of merit of around unity was first reported over four decades ago, but since then—despite investigation of various approaches—there has been only modest progress in finding materials with enhanced ZT values at room temperature. Here we report thin-film thermoelectric materials that demonstrate a significant enhancement in ZT at 300 K, compared to state-of-the-art bulk Bi2Te3 alloys. This amounts to a maximum observed factor of ∼2.4 for our p-type Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 superlattice devices. The enhancement is achieved by controlling the transport of phonons and electrons in the superlattices. Preliminary devices exhibit significant cooling (32 K at around room temperature) and the potential to pump a heat flux of up to 700 W cm-2; the localized cooling and heating occurs some 23,000 times faster than in bulk devices. We anticipate that the combination of performance, power density and speed achieved in these materials will lead to diverse technological applications: for example, in thermochemistry-on-a-chip, DNA microarrays, fibre-optic switches and microelectrothermal systems.},

We demonstrate that thousands of experimental measurements in dozens of materials can all be described by a universal curve and a single material parameter BE for each class of materials. Furthermore, any deviation in BE with temperature or doping indicated new effects such as band convergence or additional scattering. This makes BE a powerful tool for evaluating and guiding the development of thermoelectrics. We demonstrate the power of BE to show both p-type GeTe alloys and n-type Mg3SbBi alloys as highly competitive materials, at near room temperature, to state-of-the-art Bi2Te3 alloys used in nearly all commercial applications.},

The average zT of 1.08 for p-type and 0.84 for n-type bismuth telluride alloys is obtained between 25 and 250°C.

To avoid the complex numerical simulation that gives accurate efficiency, we have defined an engineering dimensionless figure of merit (ZT)eng and an engineering power factor (PF)eng as functions of the temperature difference between the cold and hot sides to predict reliably and accurately the practical conversion efficiency and output power, respectively, overcoming the reporting of unrealistic efficiency using average ZT values.},

	abstract = {Nanomechanical sensors and quantum nanosensors are two rapidly developing technologies that have diverse interdisciplinary applications in biological and chemical analysis and microscopy. For example, nanomechanical sensors based upon nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) have demonstrated chip-scale mass spectrometry capable of detecting single macromolecules, such as proteins. Quantum nanosensors based upon electron spins of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have demonstrated diverse modes of nanometrology, including single molecule magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Here, we report the first step toward combining these two complementary technologies in the form of diamond nanomechanical structures containing NV centers. We establish the principles for nanomechanical sensing using such nanospin-mechanical sensors (NSMS) and assess their potential for mass spectrometry and force microscopy. We predict that NSMS are able to provide unprecedented AC force images of cellular biomechanics and to not only detect the mass of a single macromolecule but also image its distribution. When combined with the other nanometrology modes of the NV center, NSMS potentially offer unparalleled analytical power at the nanoscale.},

	abstract = {Inducing long-range magnetic order in 3D topological insulators can gap the Dirac-like metallic surface states, leading to exotic new phases such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect or the axion insulator state. These magnetic topological phases can host robust, dissipationless charge and spin currents or unique magnetoelectric behavior, which can be exploited in low-energy electronics and spintronics applications. Although several different strategies have been successfully implemented to realize these states, to date these phenomena have been confined to temperatures below a few Kelvin. This review focuses on one strategy: inducing magnetic order in topological insulators by proximity of magnetic materials, which has the capability for room temperature operation, unlocking the potential of magnetic topological phases for applications. The unique advantages of this strategy, the important physical mechanisms facilitating magnetic proximity effect, and the recent progress to achieve, understand, and harness proximity-coupled magnetic order in topological insulators are discussed. Some emerging new phenomena and applications enabled by proximity coupling of magnetism and topological materials, such as skyrmions and the topological Hall effect, are also highlighted, and the authors conclude with an outlook on remaining challenges and opportunities in the field.},

	abstract = {Strongly correlated systems can give rise to spectacular phenomenology, from high-temperature superconductivity to the emergence of states of matter characterized by long-range quantum entanglement. Low-density flat-band systems play a vital role because the energy range of the band is so narrow that the Coulomb interactions dominate over kinetic energy, putting these materials in the strongly-correlated regime. Experimentally, when a band is narrow in both energy and momentum, its filling may be tuned in situ across the whole range, from empty to full. Recently, one particular flat-band system—that of van der Waals heterostructures, such as twisted bilayer graphene—has exhibited strongly correlated states and superconductivity, but it is still not clear to what extent the two are linked. Here, we review the status and prospects for flat-band engineering in van der Waals heterostructures and explore how both phenomena emerge from the moiré flat bands.},

Transport measurements on twisted graphene bilayers have revealed a plethora of intertwined electronic phases, including Mott insulators, strange metals and superconductors1–5. However, signatures of such strong electronic correlations in optical spectroscopy have hitherto remained unexplored. Here we present experiments showing how excitons that are dynamically screened by itinerant electrons to form exciton-polarons6,7 can be used as a spectroscopic tool to investigate interaction-induced incompressible states of electrons. We study a molybdenum diselenide/hexagonal boron nitride/molybdenum diselenide heterostructure that exhibits a long-period moiré superlattice, as evidenced by coherent hole-tunnelling-mediated avoided crossings of an intralayer exciton with three interlayer exciton resonances separated by about five millielectronvolts. For electron densities corresponding to half-filling of the lowest moiré subband, we observe strong layer pseudospin paramagnetism, demonstrated by an abrupt transfer of all the (roughly 1,500) electrons from one molybdenum diselenide layer to the other on application of a small perpendicular electric field. Remarkably, the electronic state at half-filling of each molybdenum diselenide layer is resilient towards charge redistribution by the applied electric field, demonstrating an incompressible Mott-like state of electrons. Our experiments demonstrate that optical spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for investigating strongly correlated electron physics in the bulk and paves the way for investigating Bose–Fermi mixtures of degenerate electrons and dipolar excitons.},

Previously, to maximize the thermoelectric figure of merit in state-of-the-art materials, differences in relative scaling between σ and κ as dimensions are reduced to approach the nanoscale were utilized. Here we present an approach to thermoelectric materials using tin disulfide, SnS2, nanosheets that demonstrated a negative correlation between σ and κ. In other words, as the thickness of SnS2 decreased, σ increased whereas κ decreased. This approach leads to a thermoelectric figure of merit increase to 0.13 at 300 K, a factor ∼1,000 times greater than previously reported bulk single-crystal SnS2. The Seebeck coefficient obtained for our two-dimensional SnS2 nanosheets was 34.7 mV K−1 for 16-nm-thick samples at 300 K.},

For Bi2Te3, it is unclear whether the crystal defects can enhance ZT without a degradation in the thermopower factor. In the present study, n-type Bi2Te3 nanowires (NWs) are electrochemically synthesized to have twin-free (TF) or twin-containing (TC) microstructures with a ZT of 0.10 and 0.08, respectively, at 300 K. The ZTs of TF and TC NWs remarkably increase up to 0.21 and 0.31, when heat-treatments cause n-reduction and twins induce phonon scattering, as follows: first, the enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient from −70 to −98 μV K−1 for TF NWs and from −57 to −143 μV K−1 for TC NWs, by virtue of n-reduction; secondly, twin-driven k-reduction from 1.9 to 1.4 W m−1 K−1 of TC NWs, while the k of TF NWs increases from 2.3 to 2.6 W m−1 K−1 due to the enhanced carrier mobility. The lattice thermal conductivities of TC NW are lowered from 1.1 to 0.8 W m−1 K−1 by phonon scattering at twins. Density functional theory calculations indicate that twins do not significantly influence the Seebeck coefficient of Bi2Te3. It is strongly recommended that twins be incorporated with an optimum carrier concentration to enhance the ZT of Bi2Te3.},

However, their widespread use is limited by their low conversion efficiency, which is determined by the dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT). Significant enhancement of ZT is a great challenge owing to the common interdependence of electrical and thermal conductivity. Here, it is demonstrated that by incorporating nanoamorphous boron into the p-type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, a record high ZT of 1.6 at 375 K is achieved. It is shown that a high density of nanostructures and dislocations due to the incorporation of the boron inclusions, leads to a significant reduction of thermal conductivity and improved charge transport. The findings represent an important step to further promote the development of thermoelectric technology and its widespread application in solid-state refrigeration and power generation from waste heat.},

We found κ and g to be 1.5 W/mK and 0.23 MW/m2K, respectively. These values are much lower than those of single flakes. This difference shows the effects of interconnections between individual flakes on macroscopic thin film parameters. The properties of a Gaussian laser beam and statistical optothermal Raman mapping were used to obtain sample parameters and significantly improve measurement accuracy. This work demonstrates how to address crucial stability issues in light-sensitive materials and can be used to understand heat management in MoS2 and other 2D flake-based thin films.},

Starting with the discovery of two-dimensional TIs, the HgTe-based quantum wells [5, 6], many new topological materials have been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed. Currently known TI materials can possibly be classified into two families [7], the HgTe family and the Bi2Se3 family. The signatures found in the electronic structure of a TI also cause these materials to be excellent thermoelectric materials [8–10]. On the other hand, excellent thermoelectric materials can be also topologically trivial.

Due to their low cost and excellent mechanical properties half- and full-Heusler compounds have emerged as promising candidates for various applications. Here, we demonstrate how the thermopower of semimetallic Fe2VAl-based Heusler alloys can be significantly increased by transferring electronic states from within the pseudogap to higher energies. Density functional theory calculations predict that partial Ti and Si co-substitution in Fe2V1−xTixAl1−ySiy drives an opening of the pseudogap, that can be likewise achieved in Fe2V1−xTaxAl1−ySiy. Consequently, our experimental measurements on these co-substituted systems reveal exceptionally large thermoelectric power factors (7.3 − 10.3 mWm−1K−2 near room temperature), as well as average power factors up to 4.6 mWm−1K−2 in the most pratical temperature range (293 − 573 K).

	abstract = {Thermoelectrics enable waste heat recovery, holding promises in relieving energy and environmental crisis. Lillianite materials have been long-term ignored due to low thermoelectric efficiency. Herein we report the discovery of superior thermoelectric performance in Pb7Bi4Se13 based lillianites, with a peak figure of merit, zT of 1.35 at 800 K and a high average zT of 0.92 (450–800 K). A unique quality factor is established to predict and evaluate thermoelectric performances. It considers both band nonparabolicity and band gaps, commonly negligible in conventional quality factors. Such appealing performance is attributed to the convergence of effectively nested conduction bands, providing a high number of valley degeneracy, and a low thermal conductivity, stemming from large lattice anharmonicity, low-frequency localized Einstein modes and the coexistence of high-density moiré fringes and nanoscale defects. This work rekindles the vision that Pb7Bi4Se13 based lillianites are promising candidates for highly efficient thermoelectric energy conversion.},

	abstract = {Commensurate-incommensurate transitions are ubiquitous in physics and are often accompanied by intriguing phenomena. In few-layer graphene (FLG) systems, commensurability between honeycomb lattices on adjacent layers is regulated by their relative orientation angle θ, which is in turn dependent on sample preparation procedures. Because incommensurability suppresses interlayer hybridization, it is often claimed that graphene layers can be electrically isolated by a relative twist, even though they are vertically separated by a fraction of a nanometer. We present a theory of interlayer transport in FLG systems which reveals a richer picture in which the specific conductance depends sensitively on θ, single-layer Bloch-state lifetime, in-plane magnetic field, and bias voltage. We find that linear and differential conductances are generally large and negative near commensurate values of θ, and small and positive otherwise. We show that accounting for interlayer coupling may be essential for describing transport in FLG despite its physically insignificant effect on the band structure of the system.},

These moiré patterns can drive notable band structure reconstruction of the composite material, leading to a wide range of emergent phenomena including superconductivity1–3, magnetism4, fractional Chern insulating states5 and moiré excitons6–9. Here, we investigate devices consisting of monolayer graphene encapsulated between two crystals of boron nitride (BN), in which the rotational alignment of all three components is controlled. We find that bandgaps in the graphene arising from perfect rotational alignment with both BN layers can be modified considerably depending on whether the relative orientation of the two BN layers is 0° or 60°, suggesting a tunable transition between the absence or presence of inversion symmetry in the heterostructure. Small deviations ({\textless}1°) from perfect alignment of all three layers leads to coexisting long-wavelength moiré potentials, resulting in a highly reconstructed graphene band structure featuring multiple secondary Dirac points. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between multiple moiré patterns can be utilized to controllably modify the symmetry and electronic properties of the composite heterostructure.},

While most of the recent experiments primarily focus on the electronic-band hybridization by probing in-plane transport properties, here we report out-of-plane thermoelectric measurements across the van der Waals gap in twisted bilayer graphene, which exhibits an interplay of twist-dependent interlayer electronic and phononic hybridization. We show that at large twist angles, the thermopower is entirely driven by a novel phonon-drag effect at subnanometer scale, while the electronic component of the thermopower is recovered only when the misorientation between the layers is reduced to {\textless}6°. Our experiment shows that cross-plane thermoelectricity at low angles is exceptionally sensitive to the nature of band dispersion and may provide fundamental insights into the coherence of electronic states in twisted bilayer graphene.},

The presence of a band gap is assumed to be essential to achieve large thermoelectric power factor and figure of merit. In this work, we propose semi-metals with large asymmetry between conduction and valence bands as an alternative class of thermoelectric materials. To illustrate the idea, we study semi-metallic HgTe in details experimentally and theoretically. We employ ab initio calculations with hybrid exchange-correlation functional to accurately describe the electronic band structure in conjunction with the Boltzmann Transport theory to investigate the electronic transport properties. We calculate the lattice thermal conductivity using first principles calculations and evaluate the overall figure of merit. To validate our theoretical approach, we prepare semi-metallic HgTe samples and characterize their transport properties. Our first-principles calculations agree well with the experimental data. We show that intrinsic HgTe, a semimetal with large disparity in its electron and hole masses, has a high thermoelectric power factor that is comparable to the best known thermoelectric materials. Finally, we propose other possible materials with similar band structures as potential candidates for thermoelectric applications.},

Prior models have been limited to simplified bands and/or scattering models. In this study, we apply more rigorous scattering treatments to more realistic model band structures—upward-parabolic bands that inflect to an inverted-parabolic behavior—including cases of multiple bands. In contrast to common descriptors (e.g., quality factor and complexity factor), the degree to which multiple pockets improve thermoelectric performance is bounded by interband scattering and the relative shapes of the bands. We establish that extremely anisotropic “flat-and-dispersive” bands, although best-performing in theory, may not represent a promising design strategy in practice. Critically, we determine optimum bandwidth, dependent on temperature and lattice thermal conductivity, from perfect transport cutoffs that can in theory significantly boost zT beyond the values attainable through intrinsic band structures alone. Our analysis should be widely useful as the thermoelectric research community eyes zT {\textgreater} 3.},

During the second half of the twentieth century the figure of merit has gradually improved. This has come about through the selection of semiconducting materials with improved electronic properties and a small lattice thermal conductivity. Further advancements have been achieved by enhancing the scattering of phonons. There is also the possibility of improving the so-called power factor, that is the part of the figure of merit that contains the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity. However, it appears that it will be increasingly difficult to make further advances because of the manner in which these quantities vary with the Fermi energy. It is shown that this may set a practical limit on zT. Nevertheless, it may be possible to reach an efficiency or COP of about 40\% of that of an ideal thermodynamic machine.},

Here we show that not only are moiré excitons robust in bilayers of even large twist angles, but also properties of the moiré excitons are dependant on, and controllable by, the moiré reciprocal lattice period via twist-angle tuning. From the twist-angle dependence, we furthermore obtain the effective mass of the interlayer excitons and the electron inter-layer tunneling strength, which are difficult to measure experimentally otherwise. These findings pave the way for understanding and engineering rich moiré-lattice induced phenomena in angle-twisted semiconductor van der Waals heterostructures.},

Today, the field of topological states of matter is one of the most active and fruitful research areas for both experimentalists and theorists. The physics of topological insulators is typically well described by band theory and systems of non-interacting fermions. In contrast, several of the most fascinating effects in condensed matter physics merely exist due to electron-electron interactions, examples include superconductivity, the Kondo effect, and the Mott-Hubbard transition. The aim of this review article is to give an overview of the manifold directions which emerge when topological bandstructures and correlation physics interfere and compete. These include the study of the stability of topological bandstructures and correlated topological insulators. Interaction-induced topological phases such as the topological Kondo insulator provide another exciting topic. More exotic states of matter such as topological Mott insulator and fractional Chern insulators only exist due to the interplay of topology and strong interactions and do not have any bandstructure analogue. Eventually the relation between topological bandstructures and frustrated quantum magnetism in certain transition metal oxides is emphasized.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators in three dimensions are nonmagnetic insulators that possess metallic surface states (SSs) as a consequence of the nontrivial topology of electronic wavefunctions in the bulk of the material. They are the first known examples of topological order in bulk solids. We review the basic phenomena and experimental history, starting with the observation of topological insulator behavior in BixSb1−x by angle and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (spin-ARPES) and continuing through measurements on other materials and by other probes. A self-contained introduction to the single-particle theory is then given, followed by the many-particle definition of a topological insulator as a material with quantized magnetoelectric polarizability. The last section reviews recent work on strongly correlated topological insulators and new effects that arise from the proximity effect between a topological insulator and a superconductor. Although this article is not intended to be a comprehensive review of what is already a rather large field, we hope that it serves as a useful introduction, summary of recent progress, and guideline to future directions.},

	abstract = {A new phase of nitrogen with octagon structure has been predicted in our previous study, which we referred to as octagon-nitrogene (ON). In this work, we make further investigations of its stability and electronic structures. The phonon dispersion has no imaginary phonon modes, which indicates that ON is dynamically stable. Using ab initio molecular dynamic simulations, this structure is found to be stable up to room temperature and possibly higher, and ripples that are similar to that of graphene are formed on the ON sheet. Based on the density functional theory calculation, we find that single layer ON is a two-dimension wide gap semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 4.7 eV. This gap can be decreased by stacking due to the interlayer interactions. Biaxial tensile strain and perpendicular electric field can greatly influence the band structure of ON, in which the gap decreases and eventually closes as the biaxial tensile strain or the perpendicular electric field increases. In other words, both biaxial tensile strain and a perpendicular electric field can drive the insulator-to-metal transition, and thus can be used to engineer the band gap of ON. From our results, we see that ON has potential applications in many fields, including electronics, semiconductors, optics and spintronics.},

	abstract = {The fundamental properties of graphene are making it an attractive material for a wide variety of applications. Various techniques have been developed to produce graphene and recently we discovered the synthesis of large area graphene by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of methane on Cu foils. We also showed that graphene growth on Cu is a surface-mediated process and the films were polycrystalline with domains having an area of tens of square micrometers. In this paper, we report on the effect of growth parameters such as temperature, and methane flow rate and partial pressure on the growth rate, domain size, and surface coverage of graphene as determined by Raman spectroscopy, and transmission and scanning electron microscopy. On the basis of the results, we developed a two-step CVD process to synthesize graphene films with domains having an area of hundreds of square micrometers. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy clearly show an increase in domain size by changing the growth parameters. Transmission electron microscopy further shows that the domains are crystallographically rotated with respect to each other with a range of angles from about 13 to nearly 30°. Electrical transport measurements performed on back-gated FETs show that overall films with larger domains tend to have higher carrier mobility up to about 16 000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature.},

Consequently, the LL energies are not equally spaced and include a characteristic zero-energy state (the n = 0 LL). With the use of scanning tunneling spectroscopy of graphene grown on silicon carbide, we directly observed the discrete, non-equally–spaced energy-level spectrum of LLs, including the hallmark zero-energy state of graphene. We also detected characteristic magneto-oscillations in the tunneling conductance and mapped the electrostatic potential of graphene by measuring spatial variations in the energy of the n = 0 LL.

The remote phonon-limited mobilities for SiO2, HfO2, h-BN, and Al2O3 substrates are computed using our theory. We find that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) yields the highest peak mobility, but in the practically useful high-density range, the mobility in HfO2-supported graphene is high, despite the fact that HfO2 is a high-κ dielectric with low-frequency modes. Our theory predicts that the strong temperature dependence of the total mobility effectively vanishes at very high carrier concentrations.

The phenomenon suppresses the magnitude of the quantum correction to the conductivity and may result in the complete absence of a low-field magnetoresistance, as recently found experimentally.

	abstract = {We explore the contributions to the electrical resistance of monolayer and bilayer graphene, revealing transitions between different regimes of charge carrier scattering. In monolayer graphene at low densities, a nonmonotonic variation of the resistance is observed as a function of temperature. Such behaviour is consistent with the influence of scattering from screened Coulomb impurities. At higher densities, the resistance instead varies in a manner consistent with the influence of scattering from acoustic and optical phonons. The crossover from phonon-, to charged-impurity, limited conduction occurs once the concentration of gate-induced carriers is reduced below that of the residual carriers. In bilayer graphene, the resistance exhibits a monotonic decrease with increasing temperature for all densities, with the importance of short-range impurity scattering resulting in a “universal” density-independent (scaled) conductivity at high densities. At lower densities, the conductivity deviates from this universal curve, pointing to the importance of thermal activation of carriers out of charge puddles. These various assignments, in both systems, are made possible by an approach of “differential-conductance mapping”, which allows us to suppress quantum corrections to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing the resistivity.},

Both the C33 elastic constant and the Γ to A phonon dispersions are brought to close agreement with available data once the experimental c∕a is chosen for the calculations. The vibrational free energy and the thermal expansion, the temperature dependence of the elastic moduli and the specific heat are calculated using the quasiharmonic approximation. Graphite shows a distinctive in-plane negative thermal-expansion coefficient that reaches its lowest value around room temperature, in very good agreement with experiments. Thermal contraction in graphene is found to be three times as large; in both cases, bending acoustic modes are shown to be responsible for the contraction, in a direct manifestation of the membrane effect predicted by Lifshitz over 50years ago. Stacking directly affects the bending modes, explaining the large numerical difference between the thermal-contraction coefficients in graphite and graphene, notwithstanding their common physical origin.},

Acoustic phonons are the main heat carriers in graphene near room temperature, while optical phonons are used for counting the number of atomic planes in Raman experiments with few-layer graphene. It was shown both theoretically and experimentally that transport properties of phonons, i.e. energy dispersion and scattering rates, are substantially different in a quasi-two-dimensional system such as graphene compared to the basal planes in graphite or three-dimensional bulk crystals. The unique nature of two-dimensional phonon transport translates into unusual heat conduction in graphene and related materials. In this review, we outline different theoretical approaches developed for phonon transport in graphene, discuss contributions of the in-plane and cross-plane phonon modes, and provide comparison with available experimental thermal conductivity data. Particular attention is given to analysis of recent results for the phonon thermal conductivity of single-layer graphene and few-layer graphene, and the effects of the strain, defects, and isotopes on phonon transport in these systems.},

Excellent quantitative agreement is obtained (for carrier density n{\textgreater}1012 cm−2) with existing experimental data. The conductivity scales linearly with n/ni in the theory. We explain the experimentally observed asymmetry between electron and hole conductivities, and the high-density saturation of conductivity for the highest mobility samples. We argue that the experimentally observed saturation of conductivity at low density arises from the charged impurity induced inhomogeneity in the graphene carrier density which becomes severe for n≲ni∼1012 cm−2.},

Unlike two-dimensional electron layers in semiconductors, where the charge carriers become immobile at low densities, the carrier mobility in graphene can remain high, even when their density vanishes at the Dirac point. However, when the graphene sample is supported on an insulating substrate, potential fluctuations induce charge puddles that obscure the Dirac point physics. Here we show that the fluctuations are significantly reduced in suspended graphene samples and we report low-temperature mobility approaching 200,000 cm2 V−1 s−1 for carrier densities below 5 × 109 cm−2. Such values cannot be attained in semiconductors or non-suspended graphene. Moreover, unlike graphene samples supported by a substrate, the conductivity of suspended graphene at the Dirac point is strongly dependent on temperature and approaches ballistic values at liquid helium temperatures. At higher temperatures, above 100 K, we observe the onset of thermally induced long-range scattering.},

In particular, this review covers graphene synthesis and characterization, field-effect behavior, electronic transport properties, magnetotransport, integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, mechanical properties, transistors, optoelectronics, graphene-based sensors, and biosensors. This approach attempts to highlight both the means by which the current understanding of graphene has come about and some tools for future contributions.},

	abstract = {When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron–hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality1,2. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted3,4,5 theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction—a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure6,7. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures8,9,10,11,12 now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices.},

	abstract = {Mechanical exfoliation has been a key enabler of the exploration of the properties of two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, by providing routine access to high-quality material. The original exfoliation method, which remained largely unchanged during the past decade, provides relatively small flakes with moderate yield. Here, we report a modified approach for exfoliating thin monolayer and few-layer flakes from layered crystals. Our method introduces two process steps that enhance and homogenize the adhesion force between the outermost sheet in contact with a substrate: Prior to exfoliation, ambient adsorbates are effectively removed from the substrate by oxygen plasma cleaning, and an additional heat treatment maximizes the uniform contact area at the interface between the source crystal and the substrate. For graphene exfoliation, these simple process steps increased the yield and the area of the transferred flakes by more than 50 times compared to the established exfoliation methods. Raman and AFM characterization shows that the graphene flakes are of similar high quality as those obtained in previous reports. Graphene field-effect devices were fabricated and measured with back-gating and solution top-gating, yielding mobilities of ∼4000 and 12 000 cm2/(V s), respectively, and thus demonstrating excellent electrical properties. Experiments with other layered crystals, e.g., a bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO) superconductor, show enhancements in exfoliation yield and flake area similar to those for graphene, suggesting that our modified exfoliation method provides an effective way for producing large area, high-quality flakes of a wide range of 2D materials.},

	abstract = {Synthesizing graphene nanopores
Nanosize pores in graphene can make its electronic properties more favorable for transistor applications and may also be useful for molecular separations. Moreno et al. used Ullmann coupling to polymerize a dibromo-substituted diphenylbianthracene on a gold surface (see the Perspective by Sinitskii). Cyclodehydrogenation of the resulting polymer produced graphene nanoribbons, and cross-coupling of these structures created a nanoporous graphene sheet with pore sizes of about 1 nanometer. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy revealed an electronic structure in which semiconductor bands with an energy gap of 1 electron volt coexist with localized states created by the pores.
Science, this issue p. 199; see also p. 154
Nanosize pores can turn semimetallic graphene into a semiconductor and, from being impermeable, into the most efficient molecular-sieve membrane. However, scaling the pores down to the nanometer, while fulfilling the tight structural constraints imposed by applications, represents an enormous challenge for present top-down strategies. Here we report a bottom-up method to synthesize nanoporous graphene comprising an ordered array of pores separated by ribbons, which can be tuned down to the 1-nanometer range. The size, density, morphology, and chemical composition of the pores are defined with atomic precision by the design of the molecular precursors. Our electronic characterization further reveals a highly anisotropic electronic structure, where orthogonal one-dimensional electronic bands with an energy gap of ∼1 electron volt coexist with confined pore states, making the nanoporous graphene a highly versatile semiconductor for simultaneous sieving and electrical sensing of molecular species.
Graphene nanoribbons are synthesized on a gold surface and interconnected to create a well-defined pore network.

We compare our results to random-phase approximation (RPA) calculations and evaluate the relative importance of interlayer hopping, excitonic corrections, and screening from high energy excitations involving the σ bands. We find that the static, limiting value of α∗ falls in the range 0.25–0.35, which is higher than our previous result of 0.14, but still below the value expected from RPA. We show the reduced value is not a consequence of interlayer hopping effects, which were ignored in our previous analysis, but of a combination of excitonic effects in the π→π∗ particle-hole continuum, and background screening from the σ-bonded electrons. We find that σ-band screening is extremely strong at distances of less than a few nanometers, and should be highly effective at screening out short-distance, Hubbard-like interactions in graphene as well as other carbon allotropes.},

	abstract = {Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDMaterials by design is an appealing idea that is very hard to realize in practice. Combining the best of different ingredients in one ultimate material is a task for which we currently have no general solution. However, we do have some successful examples to draw upon: Composite materials and III-V heterostructures have revolutionized many aspects of our lives. Still, we need a general strategy to solve the problem of mixing and matching crystals with different properties, creating combinations with predetermined attributes and functionalities.
ADVANCESTwo-dimensional (2D) materials offer a platform that allows creation of heterostructures with a variety of properties. One-atom-thick crystals now comprise a large family of these materials, collectively covering a very broad range of properties. The first material to be included was graphene, a zero-overlap semimetal. The family of 2D crystals has grown to includes metals (e.g., NbSe2), semiconductors (e.g., MoS2), and insulators [e.g., hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)]. Many of these materials are stable at ambient conditions, and we have come up with strategies for handling those that are not. Surprisingly, the properties of such 2D materials are often very different from those of their 3D counterparts. Furthermore, even the study of familiar phenomena (like superconductivity or ferromagnetism) in the 2D case, where there is no long-range order, raises many thought-provoking questions.A plethora of opportunities appear when we start to combine several 2D crystals in one vertical stack. Held together by van der Waals forces (the same forces that hold layered materials together), such heterostructures allow a far greater number of combinations than any traditional growth method. As the family of 2D crystals is expanding day by day, so too is the complexity of the heterostructures that could be created with atomic precision.When stacking different crystals together, the synergetic effects become very important. In the first-order approximation, charge redistribution might occur between the neighboring (and even more distant) crystals in the stack. Neighboring crystals can also induce structural changes in each other. Furthermore, such changes can be controlled by adjusting the relative orientation between the individual elements.Such heterostructures have already led to the observation of numerous exciting physical phenomena. Thus, spectrum reconstruction in graphene interacting with hBN allowed several groups to study the Hofstadter butterfly effect and topological currents in such a system. The possibility of positioning crystals in very close (but controlled) proximity to one another allows for the study of tunneling and drag effects. The use of semiconducting monolayers leads to the creation of optically active heterostructures.The extended range of functionalities of such heterostructures yields a range of possible applications. Now the highest-mobility graphene transistors are achieved by encapsulating graphene with hBN. Photovoltaic and light-emitting devices have been demonstrated by combining optically active semiconducting layers and graphene as transparent electrodes.
OUTLOOKCurrently, most 2D heterostructures are composed by direct stacking of individual monolayer flakes of different materials. Although this method allows ultimate flexibility, it is slow and cumbersome. Thus, techniques involving transfer of large-area crystals grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), direct growth of heterostructures by CVD or physical epitaxy, or one-step growth in solution are being developed. Currently, we are at the same level as we were with graphene 10 years ago: plenty of interesting science and unclear prospects for mass production. Given the fast progress of graphene technology over the past few years, we can expect similar advances in the production of the heterostructures, making the science and applications more achievable. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/353/6298/aac9439/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Production of van der Waals heterostructures.Owing to a large number of 2D crystals available today, many functional van der Waals heterostructures can be created. What started with mechanically assembled stacks (top) has now evolved to large-scale growth by CVD or physical epitaxy (bottom).
The physics of two-dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures based on such crystals has been developing extremely fast. With these new materials, truly 2D physics has begun to appear (for instance, the absence of long-range order, 2D excitons, commensurate-incommensurate transition, etc.). Novel heterostructure devices—such as tunneling transistors, resonant tunneling diodes, and light-emitting diodes—are also starting to emerge. Composed from individual 2D crystals, such devices use the properties of those materials to create functionalities that are not accessible in other heterostructures. Here we review the properties of novel 2D crystals and examine how their properties are used in new heterostructure devices.},

The second-order spectra of single crystals and of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite are continuous and exhibit several well-defined bands which can be attributed to features in the density of vibrational states as determined from current lattice-dynamics models. The density of states deduced from the lattice-dynamics model of Nicklow, Wakabayashi, and Smith provides the best replication of the second-order Raman spectrum, but is nevertheless somewhat deficient in this regard, and in need of improvement. The dependence of the first- and second-order graphite Raman spectra on crystallite size has also been studied for a series of samples with typical dimensions Lc and La as small as 30 Å. With decreasing crystal size the features in the second-order spectrum broaden noticeably and additional broad features appear in both the first- and second-order spectra. The additional first- and second-order features are also attributed to structure in the vibrational density of states and arise from the wave-vector selection-rule relaxation that results from finite-crystal-size effects. Evidence is presented to demonstrate that the above described spectral features are intrinsic and not associated with impurity excitations.},

Here we review the state of the art, future directions and open questions in Raman spectroscopy of graphene. We describe essential physical processes whose importance has only recently been recognized, such as the various types of resonance at play, and the role of quantum interference. We update all basic concepts and notations, and propose a terminology that is able to describe any result in literature. We finally highlight the potential of Raman spectroscopy for layered materials other than graphene.},

	abstract = {The downscaling of the capacitance equivalent oxide thickness (CET) of a gate dielectric film with a high dielectric constant, such as atomic layer deposited (ALD) HfO2, is a fundamental challenge in achieving high-performance graphene-based transistors with a low gate leakage current. Here, we assess the application of various surface modification methods on monolayer graphene sheets grown by chemical vapour deposition to obtain a uniform and pinhole-free ALD HfO2 film with a substantially small CET at a wafer scale. The effects of various surface modifications, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone treatment and introduction of sputtered ZnO and e-beam-evaporated Hf seed layers on monolayer graphene, and the subsequent HfO2 film formation under identical ALD process parameters were systematically evaluated. The nucleation layer provided by the Hf seed layer (which transforms to the HfO2 layer during ALD) resulted in the uniform and conformal deposition of the HfO2 film without damaging the graphene, which is suitable for downscaling the CET. After verifying the feasibility of scaling down the HfO2 thickness to achieve a CET of {\textasciitilde}1.5 nm from an array of top-gated metal-oxide-graphene field-effect transistors, we fabricated graphene heterojunction tunnelling transistors with a record-low subthreshold swing value of {\textless}60 mV/dec on an 8″ glass wafer.},

The feasibility of e-beam deposition of hafnium and hafnium oxide layers as seeds for further growth by atomic layer deposition on graphene CVD graphene is presented here. It is shown that metallic hafnium deposited in an ultra high vacuum environment readily reacts with graphene, forming a metal-carbide, rendering it unsuitable as a seed layer for the deposition of gate oxide materials. The deposition of HfO2 by reactive e-beam under an O2 partial pressure on the other hand eliminates the reaction with the underlying graphene. The uniformity of the e-beam HfO2 seed layers is found to control the uniformity of the subsequent films deposited by atomic layer deposition. Contrary to previous studies on graphite and exfoliated graphene substrates it is found that the uniformity and thickness scalability of atomic layer deposited thin films is limited on CVD graphene, most likely due to transfer induced residues on the graphene surface.},

Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

Two-dimensional (2D) materials have a wide variety of potential applications in the electronics industry. However, certain compositions of 2D materials are difficult to obtain owing to the challenges in exfoliating thin sheets from bulk crystals. Zavabeti et al. exploited liquid metals to synthesize 2D Ga2O3, HfO2, Gd2O3, and Al2O3. The 2D sheets appear as a surface layer in gallium-based liquid metals after the Hf, Gd, or Al is dissolved into the bulk alloy. The 2D oxide that appears on the surface is the oxide with the lowest energy, suggesting that it should be possible to make other 2D oxides by using the same process.
Science, this issue p. 332
Two-dimensional (2D) oxides have a wide variety of applications in electronics and other technologies. However, many oxides are not easy to synthesize as 2D materials through conventional methods. We used nontoxic eutectic gallium-based alloys as a reaction solvent and co-alloyed desired metals into the melt. On the basis of thermodynamic considerations, we predicted the composition of the self-limiting interfacial oxide. We isolated the surface oxide as a 2D layer, either on substrates or in suspension. This enabled us to produce extremely thin subnanometer layers of HfO2, Al2O3, and Gd2O3. The liquid metal–based reaction route can be used to create 2D materials that were previously inaccessible with preexisting methods. The work introduces room-temperature liquid metals as a reaction environment for the synthesis of oxide nanomaterials with low dimensionality.
Several new 2D materials were synthesized as surface layers of gallium-based liquid metals.

As with bottom-gated graphene, interfacial plasmon-phonon (IPP) modes are formed from the coupling between the graphene plasmon and the surface polar phonon modes in the top and bottom oxides. We study the effect of the top oxide thickness on dynamic screening and electron-IPP coupling. The remote phonon-limited electron mobility μRP and electron scattering rates in a HfO2-covered, SiO2-supported single-layer graphene are computed at various electron densities n for different dielectric thickness tox. We find that μRP is much more dependent on tox at low n. They also agree with the experimentally estimated room temperature μRP from Zou et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 126601 (2010)]. The electron density dependent μRP is predicted to be between 5500 and 24200 cm2V−1s−1 from n=1012 to 1013 cm−2 at 300 K.},

It is found that though high-κ dielectrics can strongly reduce Coulombic scattering by dielectric screening, scattering from surface phonon modes arising from them wash out this advantage. Calculation shows that within the available choice of dielectrics, there is not much room for improving carrier mobility in actual devices at room temperatures.},

Owing to its high dielectric constant, strontium titanate (STO) is expected to suppress the long-range charged impurity scattering and consequently to enhance the mobility. However, the absence of such enhancement has caused some controversies regarding the scattering mechanism. In graphene devices transferred from SiO2 to STO using a newly developed technique, we observe a moderate mobility enhancement near the Dirac point, which is the point of charge neutrality achieved by adjusting the Fermi level. While bulk STO is not known as a ferroelectric material, its surface was previously reported to exhibit an outward displacement of oxygen atoms and ferroelectric-like dipole moment. When placed on STO, graphene shows strong and asymmetric hysteresis in resistivity, which is consistent with the dipole picture associated with the oxygen displacement. The hysteretic response of the surface dipole moment diminishes the polarizability, therefore weakens the ability of STO to screen the Coulomb potential of the impurities.},

Potential explanations for such behaviour include short-range disorder7,8,9,10, ‘ripples’ in graphene’s atomic structure11,12 and the presence of charged impurities7,8,13,14,15,16,17,18. Here, we conduct a systematic study of the last of these mechanisms, by monitoring changes in electronic characteristics of initially clean graphene19 as the density of charged impurities (nimp) is increased by depositing potassium atoms onto its surface in ultrahigh vacuum. At non-zero carrier density, charged-impurity scattering produces the widely observed linear dependence1,2,3,4,5,6 of σ(n). More significantly, we find that σmin occurs not at the carrier density that neutralizes nimp, but rather the carrier density at which the average impurity potential is zero15. As nimp increases, σmin initially falls to a minimum value near 4e2/h. This indicates that σmin in the present experimental samples1,2,3,4,5,6 is governed not by the physics of the Dirac point singularity20,21, but rather by carrier-density inhomogeneities induced by the potential of charged impurities6,8,14,15.},

The contrast value can easily be obtained by reading the red (R), green (G) and blue (B) values at each pixel of the optical images of the sample and substrate, and this value increases linearly with sample thickness, in agreement with our calculation based on the Fresnel equation. This method is fast, easily performed and no expensive equipment is needed, which will be an important factor for large-scale sample production.

The breaking strength is 42 N m–1 and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young's modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = –2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of σint = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite. These experiments establish graphene as the strongest material ever measured, and show that atomically perfect nanoscale materials can be mechanically tested to deformations well beyond the linear regime.
Measurements of the elastic properties of graphene agree with calculations for a defect-free material and show that it is indeed stronger than other materials.

We show that its electronic structure is captured in its Raman spectrum that clearly evolves with the number of layers. The D peak second order changes in shape, width, and position for an increasing number of layers, reflecting the change in the electron bands via a double resonant Raman process. The G peak slightly down-shifts. This allows unambiguous, high-throughput, nondestructive identification of graphene layers, which is critically lacking in this emerging research area.},

In order to expose these groups, organic compounds at the surface must be removed. We present a qualitative evaluation of eight chemical methods commonly used to clean glass microscope slides in preparation for silanization. Mean contact angle of deionized water was measured before covalent attachment of (3-mercaptopropyl)triethoxysilane to assess the efficacy of each procedure. Contact angles were also measured after silanization as a means of determining the uniformity and reproducibility of the silane monolayer. The results indicate that a 1:1 methanol/HC1 wash followed by a bath in concentrated H2SO4 removes surface contaminants most effectively and allows for a very even silanization of the glass surface.},

The optical contrast differences between the substrates and 2D nanosheets with different layer numbers were collected and tabulated, serving as a standard reference, from which the layer number of a given nanosheet can be readily and reliably determined without using complex calculation or expensive instrument.

	abstract = {Three dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs) are an important class of materials with applications in electronics, spintronics and quantum computing. With the recent development of truly bulk insulating 3D TIs, it has become possible to realize surface dominated phenomena in electrical transport measurements e.g. the quantum Hall (QH) effect of massless Dirac fermions in topological surface states (TSS). However, to realize more advanced devices and phenomena, there is a need for a platform to tune the TSS or modify them e.g. gap them by proximity with magnetic insulators, in a clean manner. Here we introduce van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in the form of topological insulator/insulator/graphite to effectively control chemical potential of the TSS. Two types of gate dielectrics, normal insulator hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and ferromagnetic insulator Cr2Ge2Te6 (CGT) are utilized to tune charge density of TSS in the quaternary TI BiSbTeSe2. hBN/graphite gating in the QH regime shows improved quantization of TSS by suppression of magnetoconductivity of massless Dirac fermions. CGT/graphite gating of massive Dirac fermions in the QH regime yields half-quantized Hall conductance steps and a measure of the Dirac gap. Our work shows the promise of the vdW platform in creating advanced high-quality TI-based devices.},

	abstract = {Manipulation of the electronic properties of 2D materials with molecular adsorption has been widely reported in the past decade. However, the impact of adsorption of molecules on the magnetism of intrinsic 2D magnets is not yet sufficiently understood. Inspired by the recent discovery of intrinsic 2D ferromagnetism in atomically thin Cr2Ge2Te6 and CrI3 crystals, in this investigation, the adsorption of gas molecules including CO, CO2, H2O, N2, NH3, NO, NO2, O2 and SO2 on the basal plane of a Cr2Ge2Te6 (CGT) monolayer was systematically investigated by density functional theory. The structures, energy, charge transfer, work function, and electronic and magnetic properties of the gas molecule adsorbed Cr2Ge2Te6 monolayers were explored. It has been found that the adsorption of gas molecules significantly influences the electronic and magnetic properties of a CGT sheet. It was observed that the adsorption of molecules could effectively enhance the ferromagnetism and Curie temperature (TC) of the CGT sheet. Notably, a remarkable enhancement of ferromagnetism and TC by 38\% and 32\% was achieved by the adsorption of NO and NO2, respectively. Moreover, NO2 adsorbed CGT exhibits a semiconductor-to-metal transition. The enhanced ferromagnetism and tunable electronic structure could be ascribed to the considerable charge transfer as well as to the alignment of the frontier molecular orbital. The outcome of this study reveals not only exciting insights into the environmental effect on 2D magnets but also provides a new candidate as a NO2 gas sensor.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional ferromagnet Cr2Ge2Te6 (CGT) is so resistive below its Curie temperature that probing its magnetism by electrical transport becomes extremely difficult. By forming heterostructures with Pt, however, we observe clear anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in 5 nm thick Pt deposited on thin ({\textless}50 nm) exfoliated flakes of CGT. The AHE hysteresis loops persist to ∼60 K, which matches well to the Curie temperature of CGT obtained from the bulk magnetization measurements. The slanted AHE loops with a narrow opening indicate magnetic domain formation, which is confirmed by low-temperature magnetic force microscopy (MFM) imaging. These results clearly demonstrate that CGT imprints its magnetization in the AHE signal of the Pt layer. Density functional theory calculations of CGT/Pt heterostructures suggest that the induced ferromagnetism in Pt may be primarily responsible for the observed AHE. Our results establish a powerful way of investigating magnetism in 2D insulating ferromagnets, which can potentially work for monolayer devices.},

	abstract = {We have studied the ambient air oxidation of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown monolayers of the semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (S-TMD) WS2 using optical microscopy, laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Monolayer WS2 exposed to ambient conditions in the presence of light (typical laboratory ambient light for weeks or typical PL spectroscopy map) exhibits damage due to oxidation which can be detected with the LSCM and AFM, though may not be evident in conventional optical microscopy due to poorer contrast and resolution. Additionally, this oxidation was not random and was correlated with “high-symmetry” high intensity edges and red-shifted areas in the PL spectroscopy map, areas thought to contain a higher concentration of sulfur vacancies. In contrast, samples kept in ambient and darkness showed no signs of oxidation for up to 10 months. Low-irradiance/fluence experiments showed that samples subjected to excitation energies at or above the trion excitation energy (532 nm/2.33 eV and 660 nm/1.88 eV) oxidized in as little as 7 days, even for irradiances and fluences 8 and 4 orders of magnitude lower (respectively) than previously reported. No significant oxidation was observed for 760 nm/1.63 eV light exposure, which lies below the trion excitation energy in WS2. The strong wavelength dependence and apparent lack of irradiance dependence suggests that ambient oxidation of WS2 is initiated by photon-mediated electronic band transitions, that is, photo-oxidation. These findings have important implications for prior, present, and future studies concerning S-TMDs measured, stored, or manipulated in ambient conditions.},

	abstract = {Bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) is a topological insulator with metallic surface states (SS) residing in a large bulk bandgap. In experiments, synthesized Bi2Se3 is often heavily n-type doped due to selenium vacancies. Furthermore, it is discovered from experiments on bulk single crystals that Bi2Se3 gets additional n-type doping after exposure to the atmosphere, thereby reducing the relative contribution of SS in total conductivity. In this article, transport measurements on Bi2Se3 nanoribbons provide additional evidence of such environmental doping process. Systematic surface composition analyses by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal fast formation and continuous growth of native oxide on Bi2Se3 under ambient conditions. In addition to n-type doping at the surface, such surface oxidation is likely the material origin of the degradation of topological SS. Appropriate surface passivation or encapsulation may be required to probe topological SS of Bi2Se3 by transport measurements.},

Subsequently, we give the full microscopic derivation of the model Hamiltonian introduced by Zhang et al. [Nat. Phys. 5, 438 (2009)] based both on symmetry principles and the k⋅p perturbation theory. Two different types of k3 terms, which break the in-plane full rotation symmetry down to threefold rotation symmetry, are taken into account. An effective Hamiltonian is derived for the topological surface states. Both bulk and surface models are investigated in the presence of an external magnetic field, and the associated Landau level structure is presented.

	abstract = {Ferromagnetic insulator thin films can convey information by spin waves, avoiding charge displacement and Eddy current losses. The sparsity of high-temperature insulating ferromagnetic materials hinders the development of spin-wave-based devices. Stoichiometric magnesium titanate, MgTiO3, has an electronic-energy-band structure in which all bands are either full or empty, being a paramagnetic insulator. The MgTiO3 ilmenite consists of ordered octahedra and a cation network in which one-third of the octahedra are vacant, one-third host magnesium, and one-third titanium. By giving up these characteristics, a rich variety of different magnetic structures can be formed. Our experiments and electronic-energy-band-structure computations show that the magnetic and electric properties of Mg–Ti–O films can drastically be changed and controlled by Mg- and Ti-cation arrangement and abundancy in the octahedra. Insulating titanium- and semiconducting magnesium-rich films exhibited reversible magnetization up to elevated temperatures. The presence and origin of the insulating phase with reversible magnetization, assigned to ferromagnetic ordering, is not apparent. The expectation, based on the well-established rules set by Goodenough and Kanamori, is paramagnetic or antiferromagnetic ordering. We show that ferro- and paramagnetic phases, possessing the same stoichiometry, can be obtained by merely rearranging the cations, thus allowing defect-free interfaces in multilayer structures.},

	abstract = {Topological surface states (TSSs) in a topological insulator are expected to be able to produce a spin-orbit torque that can switch a neighboring ferromagnet. This effect may be absent if the ferromagnet is conductive because it can completely suppress the TSSs, but it should be present if the ferromagnet is insulating. This study reports TSS-induced switching in a bilayer consisting of a topological insulator Bi2Se3 and an insulating ferromagnet BaFe12O19. A charge current in Bi2Se3 can switch the magnetization in BaFe12O19 up and down. When the magnetization is switched by a field, a current in Bi2Se3 can reduce the switching field by {\textasciitilde}4000 Oe. The switching efficiency at 3 K is 300 times higher than at room temperature; it is {\textasciitilde}30 times higher than in Pt/BaFe12O19. These strong effects originate from the presence of more pronounced TSSs at low temperatures due to enhanced surface conductivity and reduced bulk conductivity.
With a topological insulator/magnetic insulator bilayer, we demonstrate topological surface state–driven magnetization switching.

This leads to a rich variety of physical phenomena, differently affecting intrinsic and extrinsic magnetic properties.

	abstract = {From Long to Short
When you play a string instrument, you raise the frequency, or pitch, of the note by shortening the vibrating portion of the string: Drop the length in half, and you hear a harmonic at double the frequency. It is possible to do essentially the same thing with light waves by using selective excitation and relaxation processes of the electrons in crystals or high-pressure gases through which the beam of light is directed to produce light harmonics. Over the past decade, researchers have been optimizing the conversion of red light to the far edge of the ultraviolet, which corresponds to tens of harmonics. Popmintchev et al. (p. 1287) now show that mid-infrared light can undergo a process in high-pressure gas to generate ultrahigh harmonics up to orders greater than 5000 in the x-ray regime.
High-harmonic generation (HHG) traditionally combines {\textasciitilde}100 near-infrared laser photons to generate bright, phase-matched, extreme ultraviolet beams when the emission from many atoms adds constructively. Here, we show that by guiding a mid-infrared femtosecond laser in a high-pressure gas, ultrahigh harmonics can be generated, up to orders greater than 5000, that emerge as a bright supercontinuum that spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum from the ultraviolet to more than 1.6 kilo–electron volts, allowing, in principle, the generation of pulses as short as 2.5 attoseconds. The multiatmosphere gas pressures required for bright, phase-matched emission also support laser beam self-confinement, further enhancing the x-ray yield. Finally, the x-ray beam exhibits high spatial coherence, even though at high gas density the recolliding electrons responsible for HHG encounter other atoms during the emission process.
An electron excitation process in a high-pressure gas converts infrared light into a well-confined beam of x-rays.

Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit have shown how great difficulties which atomic theory had met in the attempt to explain spectral structure and Zeeman effects, can be avoided by using the idea of the spinning electron. Although their theory is in complete qualitative agreement with observation, it involved an apparent quantitative discrepancy. The value of the precession of the spin axis in an external magnetic field required to account for Zeeman effects seemed to lead to doublet separations twice those which are observed. This discrepancy, however, disappears when the kinematical problem concerned is examined more closely from the point of view of the theory of relativity.},

The interaction energy U is calculated in the restframe of the nucleus, around which an electron, having linear velocity v and magnetic dipolemoment μ, travels in a circular orbit. The interaction energy U is due to the coupling of the induced electric dipole P = (v/c) × μ with the electric ﬁeld En of the nucleus. Assuming the radius of the electron’s orbit remains constant during a spin-ﬂip transition, our model predicts that the energy of the system changes by Δ = ½U, the factor ½ emerging naturally as a consequence of equilibrium and the change of the kinetic energy of the electron. The correct ½ factor for the spin–orbit coupling energy is thus derived without the need to invoke the wellknown Thomas precession in the rest-frame of the electron.},

The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter4,5, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon6,7) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective ‘speed of light’ c* ≈ 106 m s-1. Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass mc of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = mcc*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are materials with a bulk excitation gap generated by the spin-orbit interaction that are different from conventional insulators. This distinction is characterized by Z2 topological invariants, which characterize the ground state. In two dimensions, there is a single Z2 invariant that distinguishes the ordinary insulator from the quantum spin-Hall phase. In three dimensions, there are four Z2 invariants that distinguish the ordinary insulator from “weak” and “strong” topological insulators. These phases are characterized by the presence of gapless surface (or edge) states. In the two-dimensional quantum spin-Hall phase and the three-dimensional strong topological insulator, these states are robust and are insensitive to weak disorder and interactions. In this paper, we show that the presence of inversion symmetry greatly simplifies the problem of evaluating the Z2 invariants. We show that the invariants can be determined from the knowledge of the parity of the occupied Bloch wave functions at the time-reversal invariant points in the Brillouin zone. Using this approach, we predict a number of specific materials that are strong topological insulators, including the semiconducting alloy Bi1−xSbx as well as α−Sn and HgTe under uniaxial strain. This paper also includes an expanded discussion of our formulation of the topological insulators in both two and three dimensions, as well as implications for experiments.},

In three dimensions, there are four such invariants per band pair. The Z2 invariants of a crystal determine the transitions between ordinary and topological insulators as its bands are occupied by electrons.

The ﬂow of spins is determined by the spin-dependent transport properties, like conductivity, interface resistance, and spin-ﬂip scattering in the magnetic multilayer. When an electron spin carried by the current interacts with a magnetic layer, the exchange interaction leads to torques between the spin and the magnetization. The torque that results from this interaction excites the magnetization when the current is large enough. The qualitative features of the dynamics that result from current-induced torques are captured by a simple model in which the magnetization of the layer is assumed to be uniform. Even greater agreement results when ﬁnite temperature eﬀects are included and the magnetization is allowed to vary throughout the ﬁlm.},

Here, we report a facile method to disassemble vdW single crystals layer by layer into monolayers with near-unity yield and with dimensions limited only by bulk crystal sizes. The macroscopic monolayers are comparable in quality to microscopic monolayers from conventional Scotch tape exfoliation. The monolayers can be assembled into macroscopic artificial structures, including transition metal dichalcogenide multilayers with broken inversion symmetry and substantially enhanced nonlinear optical response. This approach takes us one step closer to mass production of macroscopic monolayers and bulk-like artificial materials with controllable properties.},

We develop a tight-binding model of the heterostructure adopting a minimal interfacial hybridization scheme that promotes induced magnetic exchange on the topological surface states, as well as induced Rashba-like spin-orbit coupling in the ferromagnet. Therefore our model accounts for the spin Hall effect from bulk states together with inverse spin galvanic and magnetoelectric effects at the interface on equal footing. By varying the transport energy across the band structure, we uncover a crossover from surface-dominated to bulk-dominated transport regimes. We show that the spin density profile and the nature of the spin-orbit torques differ substantially in both regimes. Our results, which compare favorably with experimental observations, demonstrate that the large dampinglike torque reported recently is more likely attributed to the Berry curvature of interfacial states, while spin Hall torque remains small even in the bulk-dominated regime.},

	abstract = {Electrical-current-induced magnetization switching is a keystone concept in the development of spintronics devices. In the last few years, this field has experienced a significant boost with the discovery of spin orbit torque (SOT) in magnetic heterostructures. Here, the recent results as to the characterization and manipulation of SOT in various heavy-metal/ferromagnet heterostructures are summarized. First, different electrical measurement methods that allow the physical features of SOT to be revealed are introduced. Second, it is shown that SOT in magnetic heterostructures can be manipulated via various material engineering approaches. The interfacial and bulk contributions of SOT are also discussed. These results advance the understanding of SOT and provide novel approaches toward energy-efficient spintronic devices.},

By varying the Gd metal layer thickness from 0 nm to 8 nm, harmonic measurements reveal a significant enhancement of the effective fields generated from the Slonczewski-like and field-like torques. ST-FMR measurements confirm an enhanced effective spin Hall angle and show a corresponding increase in the magnetic damping constant with increasing Gd thickness. These results suggest that Gd plays an active role in generating SOTs in these heterostructures.

	abstract = {We have studied the underlayer thickness and temperature dependencies of the current-induced effective field in CoFeB/MgO heterostructures with Ta-based underlayers. The underlayer thickness at which the effective field saturates is found to be different between the two orthogonal components of the effective field; i.e., the dampinglike term tends to saturate at a smaller underlayer thickness than the fieldlike term. For large underlayer thickness films in which the effective field saturates, we find that the measurement temperature significantly influences the size of the effective field. A striking difference is found in the temperature dependence of the two components: the dampinglike term decreases whereas the fieldlike term increases with increasing temperature. Using a simple spin diffusion-spin transfer model, we find that all of these results can be accounted for provided the real and imaginary parts of an effective spin mixing conductance are negative. These results imply that either spin transport in this system is different from conventional metallic interfaces or effects other than spin diffusion into the magnetic layer need to be taken into account in order to model the system accurately.},

We further show that, very different from the conventional surface states, backscattering of the topological states by nonmagnetic impurities is completely suppressed.

	abstract = {A topologically ordered material is characterized by a rare quantum organization of electrons that evades the conventional spontaneously broken symmetry–based classification of condensed matter. Exotic spin-transport phenomena, such as the dissipationless quantum spin Hall effect, have been speculated to originate from a topological order whose identification requires a spin-sensitive measurement, which does not exist to this date in any system. Using Mott polarimetry, we probed the spin degrees of freedom and demonstrated that topological quantum numbers are completely determined from spin texture–imaging measurements. Applying this method to Sb and Bi1–xSbx, we identified the origin of its topological order and unusual chiral properties. These results taken together constitute the first observation of surface electrons collectively carrying a topological quantum Berry's phase and definite spin chirality, which are the key electronic properties component for realizing topological quantum computing bits with intrinsic spin Hall–like topological phenomena.
Spin imaging reveals an insulating state that results from the entanglement of a macroscopic number of spins.

Yet, by breaking the lattice symmetry it is possible to circumvent this limitation. Here, using a unique technique for measuring transient currents upon rapid heating, direct experimental evidence is provided that despite the fact that bulk SrTiO3 is not pyroelectric, the (100) surface of TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 is intrinsically pyroelectric at room temperature. The pyroelectric layer is found to be ≈1 nm thick and, surprisingly, its polarization is comparable with that of strongly polar materials such as BaTiO3. The pyroelectric effect can be tuned ON/OFF by the formation or removal of a nanometric SiO2 layer. Using density functional theory, the pyroelectricity is found to be a result of polar surface relaxation, which can be suppressed by varying the lattice symmetry breaking using a SiO2 capping layer. The observation of pyroelectricity emerging at the SrTiO3 surface also implies that it is intrinsically piezoelectric. These findings may pave the way for observing and tailoring piezo- and pyroelectricity in any material through appropriate breaking of symmetry at surfaces and artificial nanostructures such as heterointerfaces and superlattices.},

	abstract = {Heusler compounds are a remarkable class of intermetallic materials with 1:1:1 (often called Half-Heusler) or 2:1:1 composition comprising more than 1500 members. Today, more than a century after their discovery by Fritz Heusler, they are still a field of active research. New properties and potential fields of applications emerge constantly; the prediction of topological insulators is the most recent example. Surprisingly, the properties of many Heusler compounds can easily be predicted by the valence electron count. Their extremely flexible electronic structure offers a toolbox which allows the realization of demanded but apparently contradictory functionalities within one ternary compound. Devices based on multifunctional properties, i.e. the combination of two or more functions such as superconductivity and topological edge states will revolutionize technological applications. The subgroup of more than 250 semiconductors is of high relevance for the development of novel materials for energy technologies. Their band gaps can readily be tuned from zero to ≈4eV by changing the chemical composition. Thus, great interest has been attracted in the fields of thermoelectrics and solar cell research. The wide range of their multifunctional properties is also reflected in extraordinary magneto-optical, magnetoelectronic, and magnetocaloric properties. The most prominent example is the combination of magnetism and exceptional transport properties in spintronic devices. To take advantage of the extremely high potential of Heusler compounds simple rules for the understanding of the structure, the electronic structure and the relation to the properties are reviewed.},

The breakdown current density is found to have a reciprocal relationship to GNR resistivity and the data fit points to Joule heating as the likely mechanism of breakdown. The superior current-carrying capacity of GNRs will be valuable for their application in on-chip electrical interconnects. The thermal conductivity of sub-20 nm graphene ribbons is found to be more than 1000 W/m K.},

Large numbers of such short devices are obtained without the need of complex tools such as electron beam lithography. Metallic SWCNTs with lengths of ≈10 nm, near the mean free path of l op ≈ 15 nm for optical phonon scattering, exhibit nearly ballistic transport at high biases and can carry unprecedented 100-μA currents per tube. Semiconducting SWCNT fieldeffect transistors with ≈50-nm channel lengths are routinely produced to achieve quasi-ballistic operations for molecular transistors. The results demonstrate highly length-scaled and high-performance interconnects and transistors realized with SWCNTs.},

Suspension ∼150 nm above a Si/SiO2 gate electrode and electrical contacts to the graphene was achieved by a combination of electron beam lithography and etching. The specimens were cleaned in situ by employing current-induced heating, directly resulting in a significant improvement of electrical transport. Concomitant with large mobility enhancement, the widths of the characteristic Dirac peaks are reduced by a factor of 10 compared to traditional, nonsuspended devices. This advance should allow for accessing the intrinsic transport properties of graphene.},

Recent studies of thermal Hall conductivity, \${\textbackslash}kappa\_\{xy\}\$, in a variety of contexts, however, have assumed a negligibly small phonon contribution. We present a study of \${\textbackslash}kappa\_\{xy\}\$ in quantum paraelectric SrTiO\$\_3\$ and find that its peak value exceeds what has been reported in any other insulator, including those in which the signal has been qualified as 'giant'. Remarkably, \${\textbackslash}kappa\_\{xy\}(T)\$ and \${\textbackslash}kappa(T)\$ peak at the same temperature and the former decreases faster than the latter at both sides of the peak. This hitherto unreported behavior is also visible in the case of La\$\_2\$CuO\$\_4\$ and \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-RuCl\$\_3\$. We also studied KTaO\$\_3\$ and found a small signal, indicating that a sizable \${\textbackslash}kappa\_\{xy\}(T)\$ is not a generic feature of quantum paraelectrics. Combined to other observations, this points to a crucial role played by antiferrodistortive domains in generating \${\textbackslash}kappa\_\{xy\}\$ of this solid.},

Topological insulators are ﬁnding applications in magnetic devices, while Hall transport in doped samples and the general issue of topological protection remain controversial. In transition metal dichalcogenides valley-dependent electrical and optical phenomena continue to stimulate state-of-the-art experiments. In Weyl semimetals the properties of Fermi arcs are being actively investigated. A new ﬁeld, expected to grow in the near future, focuses on the non-linear electrical and optical responses of topological materials, where fundamental questions are once more being asked about the intertwining roles of the Berry curvature and disorder scattering. In topological superconductors the quest for chiral superconductivity, Majorana fermions and topological quantum computing is continuing apace.},

The interaction energy ������������ is calculated in the rest-frame of the nucleus, around which an electron, having linear velocity ������������ and magnetic dipole-moment ������������, travels in a circular orbit. The interaction energy ������������ is due to the coupling of the induced electric dipole ������������ = (������������/������������) × ������������ with the electric field ������������������������ of the nucleus. Assuming the radius of the electron’s orbit remains constant during a spin-flip transition, our model predicts that the energy of the system changes by ∆ℰ = ½������������, the factor ½ emerging naturally as a consequence of equilibrium and the change of the kinetic energy of the electron. The correct ½ factor for the spin-orbit coupling energy is thus derived without the need to invoke the well-known Thomas precession in the rest-frame of the electron.},

	abstract = {A consequence of relativity is that in the presence of an electric field, the spin and momentum states of an electron can be coupled; this is known as spin–orbit coupling. Such an interaction opens a pathway to the manipulation of electron spins within non-magnetic semiconductors, in the absence of applied magnetic fields. This interaction has implications for spin-based quantum information processing1 and spintronics2,3, forming the basis of various device proposals4,5,6,7,8. For example, the concept of spin field-effect transistors4,5 is based on spin precession due to the spin–orbit coupling. Most studies, however, focus on non-spin-selective electrical measurements in quantum structures. Here we report the direct measurement of coherent electron spin precession in zero magnetic field as the electrons drift in response to an applied electric field. We use ultrafast optical techniques to spatiotemporally resolve spin dynamics in strained gallium arsenide and indium gallium arsenide epitaxial layers. Unexpectedly, we observe spin splitting in these simple structures arising from strain in the semiconductor films. The observed effect provides a flexible approach for enabling electrical control over electron spins using strain engineering. Moreover, we exploit this strain-induced field to electrically drive spin resonance with Rabi frequencies of up to ∼30 MHz.},

We measure reliable switching, with write error rates down to 10−5, using current pulses as short as just 2 ns in duration. This represents the fastest reliable switching reported to date for any spin-torquedriven magnetic memory geometry and corresponds to a characteristic time scale that is signiﬁcantly shorter than predicted possible within a macrospin model for in-plane MTJs subject to thermal ﬂuctuations at room temperature. Using micromagnetic simulations, we show that in the three-terminal spin-Hall devices the Oersted magnetic ﬁeld generated by the pulse current strongly modiﬁes the magnetic dynamics excited by the spin-Hall torque, enabling this unanticipated performance improvement. Our results suggest that in-plane MTJs controlled by Oersted-ﬁeld-assisted spin-Hall torque are a promising candidate for both cache memory applications requiring high speed and for cryogenic memories requiring low write energies.},

Then we show that resonant spin pumping at room temperature from Fe through Ag into α-Sn layers induces a lateral charge current that can be ascribed to the inverse Edelstein effect by the DC states. Our observation of an inverse Edelstein effect length much longer than those generally found for Rashba interfaces demonstrates the potential of TIs for the conversion between spin and charge in spintronic devices. By comparing our results with data on the relaxation time of TI free surface states from time-resolved ARPES, we can anticipate the ultimate potential of the TI for spin to charge conversion and the conditions to reach it.},

Breaking time-reversal symmetry in these systems via ferromagnetism induces a gapped state characterized by a zero magnetic field quantized Hall response—the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state6,7,8. A key question that has remained experimentally unexplored is the relationship of this new type of quantum Hall (QH) state with the previously known orbitally driven QH states. Here, we show experimentally that a ferromagnetic topological insulator exhibiting the QAH state is well described by the global phase diagram of the QH effect. By mapping the conductivity tensor in the vicinity of the QAH phase, we find evidence for quantum criticality and delocalization behaviour9,10 that can quantitatively be described by the renormalization group properties of the QH ground state11,12. This result demonstrates that this QAH state can be understood within the context of the law of corresponding states that governs the QH state13,14.},

Here, we report the observation of room temperature ferromagnetism in manganese selenide (MnSex) films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Magnetic and structural characterization provides strong evidence that, in the monolayer limit, the ferromagnetism originates from a vdW manganese diselenide (MnSe2) monolayer, while for thicker films it could originate from a combination of vdW MnSe2 and/or interfacial magnetism of α-MnSe(111). Magnetization measurements of monolayer MnSex films on GaSe and SnSe2 epilayers show ferromagnetic ordering with a large saturation magnetization of ∼4 Bohr magnetons per Mn, which is consistent with the density functional theory calculations predicting ferromagnetism in monolayer 1T-MnSe2. Growing MnSex films on GaSe up to a high thickness (∼40 nm) produces α-MnSe(111) and an enhanced magnetic moment (∼2×) compared to the monolayer MnSex samples. Detailed structural characterization by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) reveals an abrupt and clean interface between GaSe(0001) and α-MnSe(111). In particular, the structure measured by STEM is consistent with the presence of a MnSe2 monolayer at the interface. These results hold promise for potential applications in energy efficient information storage and processing.},

However, controlled synthesis of large uniform monolayer and multi-layer 2D crystals is still challenging. Here, we report the controlled synthesis of 2D GaSe crystals on SiO2/Si substrates using a vapor phase deposition method. For the first time, uniform, large (up to {\textasciitilde}60 μm in lateral size), single-crystalline, triangular monolayer GaSe crystals were obtained and their structure and orientation were characterized from atomic scale to micrometer scale. The size, density, shape, thickness, and uniformity of the 2D GaSe crystals were shown to be controllable by growth duration, growth region, growth temperature, and argon carrier gas flow rate. The theoretical modeling of the electronic structure and Raman spectroscopy demonstrate a direct-to-indirect bandgap transition and progressive confinement-induced bandgap shifts for 2D GaSe crystals. The 2D GaSe crystals show p-type semiconductor characteristics and high photoresponsivity ({\textasciitilde}1.7 A/W under white light illumination) comparable to exfoliated GaSe nanosheets.

	abstract = {When electrons are subject to a large external magnetic field, the conventional charge quantum Hall effect1,2 dictates that an electronic excitation gap is generated in the sample bulk, but metallic conduction is permitted at the boundary. Recent theoretical models suggest that certain bulk insulators with large spin–orbit interactions may also naturally support conducting topological boundary states in the quantum limit3,4,5, which opens up the possibility for studying unusual quantum Hall-like phenomena in zero external magnetic fields6. Bulk Bi1-xSbx single crystals are predicted to be prime candidates7,8 for one such unusual Hall phase of matter known as the topological insulator9,10,11. The hallmark of a topological insulator is the existence of metallic surface states that are higher-dimensional analogues of the edge states that characterize a quantum spin Hall insulator3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. In addition to its interesting boundary states, the bulk of Bi1-xSbx is predicted to exhibit three-dimensional Dirac particles14,15,16,17, another topic of heightened current interest following the new findings in two-dimensional graphene18,19,20 and charge quantum Hall fractionalization observed in pure bismuth21. However, despite numerous transport and magnetic measurements on the Bi1-xSbx family since the 1960s17, no direct evidence of either topological Hall states or bulk Dirac particles has been found. Here, using incident-photon-energy-modulated angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (IPEM-ARPES), we report the direct observation of massive Dirac particles in the bulk of Bi0.9Sb0.1, locate the Kramers points at the sample’s boundary and provide a comprehensive mapping of the Dirac insulator’s gapless surface electron bands. These findings taken together suggest that the observed surface state on the boundary of the bulk insulator is a realization of the ‘topological metal’9,10,11. They also suggest that this material has potential application in developing next-generation quantum computing devices that may incorporate ‘light-like’ bulk carriers and spin-textured surface currents.},

	abstract = {The topological invariants of a time-reversal-invariant band structure in two dimensions are multiple copies of the Z2 invariant found by Kane and Mele. Such invariants protect the “topological insulator” phase and give rise to a spin Hall effect carried by edge states. Each pair of bands related by time reversal is described by one Z2 invariant, up to one less than half the dimension of the Bloch Hamiltonians. In three dimensions, there are four such invariants per band pair. The Z2 invariants of a crystal determine the transitions between ordinary and topological insulators as its bands are occupied by electrons. We derive these invariants using maps from the Brillouin zone to the space of Bloch Hamiltonians and clarify the connections between Z2 invariants, the integer invariants that underlie the integer quantum Hall effect, and previous invariants of T-invariant Fermi systems.},

We review theoretical models, materials properties and experimental results on two-dimensional and three-dimensional topological insulators, and discuss both the topological band theory and the topological field theory.

ARPES allows the direct measurement of the electronic band structure of materials generating extremely useful insights into their electronic properties. The possibility to apply this technique to 2D materials is of paramount importance because these ultrathin layers are considered fundamental for future electronic, photonic and spintronic devices. In this review an overview of the technical aspects of spatially localized ARPES is given along with a description of the most advanced setups for laboratory and synchrotron-based equipment. This technique is sensitive to the lateral dimensions of the sample. Therefore, a discussion on the preparation methods of 2D material is presented. Some of the most interesting results obtained by ARPES are reported in three sections including: graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and 2D heterostructures. Graphene has played a key role in ARPES studies because it inspired the use of this technique with other 2D materials. TMDCs are presented for their peculiar transport, optical and spin properties. Finally, the section featuring heterostructures highlights a future direction for research into 2D material structures.},

Although polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is generally used as a sacrificial transfer film due to its strong adhesion property, it is always dissolved in the solvent after the transfer, resulting in the unavoidable PMMA residue on the top surface. This makes it difficult to locate clean interface areas. In this work, we present a fully dry PMMA transfer of graphene onto h-BN using a heating/cooling system which allows identification of clean interface area for high quality graphene/h-BN heterostructure fabrication. The mechanism lies in the utilization of the large difference in thermal expansion coefficients between polymers (PMMA/PDMS) and inorganic materials (graphene/h-BN substrate) to mechanically peel off PMMA from graphene by the thermal shrinkage of polymers, leaving no PMMA residue on the graphene surface. This method can be applied to all types of 2D layered materials.},

In particular, the effects of stamp adhesion, normal contact force, and dwell time on the exfoliation force, layer thickness, and graphene surface morphology are studied. Experiments show that the process is capable of exfoliating relatively large (up to 12x 12 mm2) graphene layers under certain conditions. The exfoliated layers, albeit of varying thickness, have regions that are tens of nanometer thick and contain various topographical features such as bubbles, wrinkles, and compressed regions.

	abstract = {Recent advances in chemical vapour deposition have led to the fabrication of large graphene sheets on metal foils for use in research and development. However, further breakthroughs are required in the way these graphenes are transferred from their growth substrates onto the final substrate. Although various methods have been developed, as yet there is no general way to reliably transfer graphene onto arbitrary surfaces, such as ‘soft’ ones. Here, we report a method that allows the graphene to be transferred with high fidelity at the desired location on almost all surfaces, including fragile polymer thin films and hydrophobic surfaces. The method relies on a sacrificial ‘self-releasing’ polymer layer placed between a conventional polydimethylsiloxane elastomer stamp and the graphene that is to be transferred. This self-releasing layer provides a low work of adhesion on the stamp, which facilitates delamination of the graphene and its placement on the new substrate. To demonstrate the generality and reliability of our method, we fabricate high field-strength polymer capacitors using graphene as the top contact over a polymer dielectric thin film. These capacitors show superior dielectric breakdown characteristics compared with those made with evaporated metal top contacts. Furthermore, we fabricate low-operation-voltage organic field-effect transistors using graphene as the gate electrode placed over a thin polymer gate dielectric layer. We finally demonstrate an artificial graphite intercalation compound by stacking alternate monolayers of graphene and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ). This compound, which comprises graphene sheets p-doped by partial hole transfer from the F4TCNQ, shows a high and remarkably stable hole conductivity, even when heated in the presence of moisture.},

Picking up prepatterned hBN flakes to be used as a gate dielectric or mask for other 2D materials opens new possibilities for the design and fabrication of 2D heterostructures. In this Letter, we demonstrate this technique in two ways: first, a dual-gated graphene device that is encapsulated between an hBN substrate and prepatterned hBN strips. The conductance of the graphene device shows pronounced Fabry–Pérot oscillations as a function of carrier density, which implies strong quantum confinement and ballistic transport in the locally gated region. Second, we describe a WSe2 device encapsulated in hBN with the top hBN patterned as a mask for the channel of a Hall bar. Ionic liquid selectively tunes the carrier density of the contact region of the device, while the hBN mask allows independent tunability of the contact region for low contact resistance. Hall mobility larger than 600 cm2/(V·s) for few-layer p-type WSe2 at 220 K is measured, the highest mobility of a thin WSe2 device reported to date. The observations of ballistic transport in graphene and high mobility in WSe2 confirm pick-up of prepatterned hBN as a versatile technique to fabricate ultraclean devices with high quality contact.},

	abstract = {The conductivity of graphene samples with various levels of disorder is investigated for a set of specimens with mobility in the range of 1–20×103 cm2/V sec. Comparing the experimental data with the theoretical transport calculations based on charged impurity scattering, we estimate that the impurity concentration in the samples varies from 2–15×1011 cm−2. In the low carrier density limit, the conductivity exhibits values in the range of 2–12e2/h, which can be related to the residual density induced by the inhomogeneous charge distribution in the samples. The shape of the conductivity curves indicates that high mobility samples contain some short-range disorder whereas low mobility samples are dominated by long-range scatterers.},

	abstract = {We have measured the 1f voltage noise in continuous metal films. At room temperature, samples of pure metals and bismuth (with a carrier density smaller by 105) of similar volume had comparable noise. The power spectrum SV(f) was proportional to ¯V2Ωfγ, where ¯V is the mean voltage across the sample, Ω is the sample volume, and 1.0≲γ≲1.4. SV(f)¯V2 was reduced as the temperature was lowered. Manganin, with a temperature coefficient of resistance (β) close to zero, had no discernible noise. These results suggest that the noise arises from equilibrium temperature fluctuations modulating the resistance to give SV(f)∝¯V2β2kBT2CV, where CV is the total heat capacity of the sample. The noise was spatially correlated over a length λ(f)≈(Df)12, where D is the thermal diffusivity, implying that the fluctuations obey a diffusion equation. The usual theoretical treatment of spatially uncorrelated temperature fluctuations gives a spectrum that flattens at low frequencies in contradiction to the observed spectrum. However, the empirical inclusion of an explicit 1f region and appropriate normalization lead to SV(f)¯V2∝β2kBT2CV[3+2ln(lw)]f, where l is the length and w is the width of the film, in excellent agreement with the measured noise. If the fluctuations are assumed to be spatially correlated, the diffusion equation can yield an extended 1f region in the power spectrum. We show that the temperature response of a sample to δ- and step-function power inputs has the same shape as the autocorrelation function for uncorrelated and correlated temperature fluctuations, respectively. The spectrum obtained from the cosine transform of the measured step-function response is in excellent agreement with the measured 1f voltage noise spectrum. Spatially correlated equilibrium temperature fluctuations are not the dominant source of 1f noise in semiconductors and discontinuous metal films. However, the agreement between the low-frequency spectrum of fluctuations in the mean-square Johnson-noise voltage and the resistance fluctuation spectrum measured in the presence of a current demonstrates that in these systems the 1f noise is also due to equilibrium resistance fluctuations.},

The films, composed of typically three graphene sheets, were grown by thermal decomposition on the (0001) surface of 6H−SiC, and characterized by surface science techniques. The low-temperature conductance spans a range of localization regimes according to the structural state (square resistance 1.5 kΩ to 225 kΩ at 4 K, with positive magnetoconductance). Low-resistance samples show characteristics of weak localization in two dimensions, from which we estimate elastic and inelastic mean free paths. At low field, the Hall resistance is linear up to 4.5 T, which is well-explained by n-type carriers of density 1012 cm-2 per graphene sheet. The most highly ordered sample exhibits Shubnikov−de Haas oscillations that correspond to nonlinearities observed in the Hall resistance, indicating a potential new quantum Hall system. We show that the high-mobility films can be patterned via conventional lithographic techniques, and we demonstrate modulation of the film conductance using a top-gate electrode. These key elements suggest electronic device applications based on nanopatterned epitaxial graphene (NPEG), with the potential for large-scale integration.},

Understanding their intriguing electrostatics is pivotal but largely hindered by the lack of direct observations. Here graphene–WS2 heterojunctions are prepared over large areas using a seedless ambient-pressure chemical vapor deposition technique. Kelvin probe force microscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy characterize the doping in graphene–WS2 heterojunctions as-grown on sapphire and transferred to SiO2 with and without thermal annealing. Both p–n and n–n junctions are observed, and a flat-band condition (zero Schottky barrier height) is found for lightly n-doped WS2, promising low-resistance ohmic contacts. This indicates a more favorable band alignment for graphene–WS2 than has been predicted, likely explaining the low barriers observed in transport experiments on similar heterojunctions. Electrostatic modeling demonstrates that the large depletion width of the graphene–WS2 junction reflects the electrostatics of the one-dimensional junction between two-dimensional materials.},

The Landauer-Buttiker model was used to explain carrier transport at the graphene-metal interface as a function of temperature.

	abstract = {Owing to its two-dimensional structure, graphene is extremely sensitive to surface contamination. Conventional processing techniques inevitably modify graphene’s intrinsic properties by introducing adsorbents and/or defects which limit device performance and understanding the intrinsic properties of graphene. Here we demonstrate femtosecond laser direct patterning of graphene microstructures, without the aid of resists or other chemicals, that enables us to study both intrinsic and extrinsic effects on the graphene–metal interface. The pulsed femtosecond laser was configured to ablate epitaxial graphene (EG) on a sub-micrometer scale and form a precisely defined region without damaging the surrounding material or substrate. The ablated area was sufficient to electrically isolate transfer length measurement structures and Hall devices for subsequent transport measurements. Using pristine and systematically contaminated surfaces, we found that Ni does not form bonds to EG synthesized on SiC in contrast to the well-known C–Ni bond formation for graphene synthesized on metals; known as end-contacting. Without end-contacting, the contact resistance ( R C ) of Ni to pristine and resist-contaminated EG are one and two orders of magnitude larger, respectively, than the intrinsic quantum limited contact resistance. The range of reported R C values is explained using carrier transmission probability, as exemplified by the Landauer–Büttiker model, which is dependent on the presence or absence of end-contacts and dopant/work-function mediated conduction. The model predicts the need for both end-contacts and a clean graphene–metal interface as necessary conditions to approach quantum limited contact resistance.},

	abstract = {Graphene has been attracting great interest because of its distinctive band structure and physical properties. Today, graphene is limited to small sizes because it is produced mostly by exfoliating graphite. We grew large-area graphene films of the order of centimeters on copper substrates by chemical vapor deposition using methane. The films are predominantly single-layer graphene, with a small percentage (less than 5\%) of the area having few layers, and are continuous across copper surface steps and grain boundaries. The low solubility of carbon in copper appears to help make this growth process self-limiting. We also developed graphene film transfer processes to arbitrary substrates, and dual-gated field-effect transistors fabricated on silicon/silicon dioxide substrates showed electron mobilities as high as 4050 square centimeters per volt per second at room temperature.
Predominantly single-layer graphene films grow in a self-limited manner on copper and can be transferred to other substrates.

	abstract = {A van der Waals heterostructure is a type of metamaterial that consists of vertically stacked two-dimensional building blocks held together by the van der Waals forces between the layers. This design means that the properties of van der Waals heterostructures can be engineered precisely, even more so than those of two-dimensional materials1. One such property is the ‘twist’ angle between different layers in the heterostructure. This angle has a crucial role in the electronic properties of van der Waals heterostructures, but does not have a direct analogue in other types of heterostructure, such as semiconductors grown using molecular beam epitaxy. For small twist angles, the moiré pattern that is produced by the lattice misorientation between the two-dimensional layers creates long-range modulation of the stacking order. So far, studies of the effects of the twist angle in van der Waals heterostructures have concentrated mostly on heterostructures consisting of monolayer graphene on top of hexagonal boron nitride, which exhibit relatively weak interlayer interaction owing to the large bandgap in hexagonal boron nitride2,3,4,5. Here we study a heterostructure consisting of bilayer graphene, in which the two graphene layers are twisted relative to each other by a certain angle. We show experimentally that, as predicted theoretically6, when this angle is close to the ‘magic’ angle the electronic band structure near zero Fermi energy becomes flat, owing to strong interlayer coupling. These flat bands exhibit insulating states at half-filling, which are not expected in the absence of correlations between electrons. We show that these correlated states at half-filling are consistent with Mott-like insulator states, which can arise from electrons being localized in the superlattice that is induced by the moiré pattern. These properties of magic-angle-twisted bilayer graphene heterostructures suggest that these materials could be used to study other exotic many-body quantum phases in two dimensions in the absence of a magnetic field. The accessibility of the flat bands through electrical tunability and the bandwidth tunability through the twist angle could pave the way towards more exotic correlated systems, such as unconventional superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a macromolecule commonly used for graphene transfer and device processing, leaving a thin layer of residue to be empirically cleaned by annealing. Here we report on a systematic study of PMMA decomposition on graphene and of its impact on graphene’s intrinsic properties using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in combination with Raman spectroscopy. TEM images revealed that the physisorbed PMMA proceeds in two steps of weight loss in annealing and cannot be removed entirely at a graphene susceptible temperature before breaking. Raman analysis shows a remarkable blue-shift of the 2D mode after annealing, implying an anneal-induced band structure modulation in graphene with defects. Calculations using density functional theory show that local rehybridization of carbons from sp2 to sp3 on graphene defects may occur in the random scission of polymer chains and account for the blue-shift of the Raman 2D mode.},

We demonstrate this behavior by carrying out first-principles calculations on the noncentrosymmetric topological insulators LaBiTe3 and LuBiTe3 and the trivial insulator BiTeI. We find that a robust Weyl-semimetal phase exists in the solid solutions LaBi1−xSbxTe3 and LuBi1−xSbxTe3 for x≈38.5\%–41.9\% and x≈40.5\%–45.1\%, respectively. A low-energy effective model is also constructed to describe the critical behavior in these two materials. In BiTeI, a Weyl semimetal also appears with applied pressure, but only within a very small pressure range, which may explain why it has not been experimentally observed.},

Remarkably, an unusually high in-plane Fermi velocity up to 1.5 × 106 ms−1 is observed in our samples, where the mobility is known up to 40,000 cm2 V−1s−1, suggesting that Cd3As2 can be a promising candidate as an anisotropic-hypercone (three-dimensional) high spin-orbit analogue of 3D graphene. Our discovery of the Dirac-like bulk topological semimetal phase in Cd3As2 opens the door for exploring higher dimensional spin-orbit Dirac physics in a real material.},

	abstract = {Ettore Majorana (1906–1938) disappeared while traveling by ship from Palermo to Naples in 1938. His fate has never been fully resolved and several articles have been written that explore the mystery itself. His demise intrigues us still today because of his seminal work, published the previous year, that established symmetric solutions to the Dirac equation that describe a fermionic particle that is its own antiparticle. This work has long had a significant impact in neutrino physics, where this fundamental question regarding the particle remains unanswered. But the formalism he developed has found many uses as there are now a number of candidate spin-1/2 neutral particles that may be truly neutral with no quantum number to distinguish them from their antiparticles. If such particles exist, they will influence many areas of nuclear and particle physics. Most notably the process of neutrinoless double beta decay can exist only if neutrinos are massive Majorana particles. Hence, many efforts to search for this process are underway. Majorana’s influence does not stop with particle physics, however, even though that was his original consideration. The equations he derived also arise in solid-state physics where they describe electronic states in materials with superconducting order. Of special interest here is the class of solutions of the Majorana equation in one and two spatial dimensions at exactly zero energy. These Majorana zero modes are endowed with some remarkable physical properties that may lead to advances in quantum computing and, in fact, there is evidence that they have been experimentally observed. This Colloquium first summarizes the basics of Majorana’s theory and its implications. It then provides an overview of the rich experimental programs trying to find a fermion that is its own antiparticle in nuclear, particle, and solid-state physics.},

The study of such states was originally inspired by the robustness to scattering of conducting edge states in quantum Hall systems. Recently, such analogies have resulted in the discovery of topologically protected states in two-dimensional and three-dimensional band insulators with large spin–orbit coupling. So far, the only known three-dimensional topological insulator is BixSb1−x, which is an alloy with complex surface states. Here, we present the results of first-principles electronic structure calculations of the layered, stoichiometric crystals Sb2Te3, Sb2Se3, Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3. Our calculations predict that Sb2Te3, Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 are topological insulators, whereas Sb2Se3 is not. These topological insulators have robust and simple surface states consisting of a single Dirac cone at the Γ point. In addition, we predict that Bi2Se3 has a topologically non-trivial energy gap of 0.3 eV, which is larger than the energy scale of room temperature. We further present a simple and unified continuum model that captures the salient topological features of this class of materials.},

This novel electronic state of matter is gapped in the bulk and supports the transport of spin and charge in gapless edge states that propagate at the sample boundaries. The edge states are nonchiral, but they are insensitive to disorder because their directionality is correlated with spin. The spin and charge conductances in these edge states are calculated and the effects of temperature, chemical potential, Rashba coupling, disorder, and symmetry breaking fields are discussed.},

Recently, the topic of topological nodal line semimetals, materials in which Dirac or Weyl-like crossings along special lines in momentum space create either a closed ring or line of degeneracies, rather than discrete points, has become a hot topic in topological quantum matter. Here, we review the experimentally confirmed and theoretically predicted topological nodal line semimetals, focusing in particular on the symmetry protection mechanisms of the nodal lines in various materials. Three different mechanisms: a combination of inversion and time-reversal symmetry, mirror reflection symmetry, and non-symmorphic symmetry and their robustness under the effect of spin orbit coupling are discussed. We also present a new Weyl nodal line material, the Te-square net compound KCuEuTe, which has several Weyl nodal lines including one extremely close to the Fermi level (30 meV below E). Finally, we discuss potential experimental signatures for observing exotic properties of nodal line physics.},

	abstract = {Creating Unstable Atomic Orbitals
A hallmark of atomic Bohr orbitals is that they are stable; that is, time independent. However, for a very highly charged nucleus, the electrons must be described with the relativistic Dirac equation; the motion becomes time dependent, with electrons spiraling into the nucleus and coupling to positrons at large distances from the nucleus. In graphene, charge carriers are mass-less and described by the relativistic Dirac equation, and could also exhibit “atomic collapse” states. Wang et al. (p. 734, published online 7 March) created highly charged clusters of calcium dimers by atomic manipulation with a scanning tunneling microscope. The emergence of atomic-collapse resonances with increasing cluster size and charge was observed with scanning tunneling microscopy.
Relativistic quantum mechanics predicts that when the charge of a superheavy atomic nucleus surpasses a certain threshold, the resulting strong Coulomb field causes an unusual atomic collapse state; this state exhibits an electron wave function component that falls toward the nucleus, as well as a positron component that escapes to infinity. In graphene, where charge carriers behave as massless relativistic particles, it has been predicted that highly charged impurities should exhibit resonances corresponding to these atomic collapse states. We have observed the formation of such resonances around artificial nuclei (clusters of charged calcium dimers) fabricated on gated graphene devices via atomic manipulation with a scanning tunneling microscope. The energy and spatial dependence of the atomic collapse state measured with scanning tunneling microscopy revealed unexpected behavior when occupied by electrons.
The massless charge carriers in graphene interact with highly charged defects to create an analog of atomic collapse states.

	abstract = {A periodic spatial modulation, as created by a moiré pattern, has been extensively studied with the view to engineer and tune the properties of graphene. Graphene encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) when slightly misaligned with the top and bottom hBN layers experiences two interfering moiré patterns, resulting in a so-called supermoiré (SM). This leads to a lattice and electronic spectrum reconstruction. A geometrical construction of the nonrelaxed SM patterns allows us to indicate qualitatively the induced changes in the electronic properties and to locate the SM features in the density of states and in the conductivity. To emphasize the eﬀect of lattice relaxation, we report band gaps at all Dirac-like points in the hole doped part of the reconstructed spectrum, which are expected to be enhanced when including interaction eﬀects. Our result is able to distinguish eﬀects due to lattice relaxation and due to the interfering SM and provides a clear picture on the origin of recently experimentally observed eﬀects in such trilayer heterostuctures.},

However, these exotic physical effects have rarely been realized experimentally because of the lack of suitable working materials. Here, we predict a series of van der Waals layered MnBi2Te4-related materials that show intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. We find extremely rich topological quantum states with outstanding characteristics in MnBi2Te4, including an antiferromagnetic topological insulator with the long-sought topological axion states on the surface, a type II magnetic Weyl semimetal with one pair of Weyl points, as well as a collection of intrinsic axion insulators and QAH insulators in even- and odd-layer films, respectively. These notable predictions, if proven experimentally, could profoundly change future research and technology of topological quantum physics.
MnBi2Te4-related compounds can serve as a promising material platform for exploring exotic magnetic topological effects.

Since the net effect of the spin-orbit interaction is proportional to the extent to which the electron spins are aligned, this current is proportional to the magnetization. The magnitude of the Hall constant is equal to the square of the ordinary resistivity multiplied by functions that are not very sensitive to temperature and impurity content.

The phenomenon is discussed in many contexts in particle, nuclear and astro-physics but direct tests of the Klein paradox using elementary particles have so far proved impossible. Here we show that the effect can be tested in a conceptually simple condensed-matter experiment using electrostatic barriers in single- and bi-layer graphene. Owing to the chiral nature of their quasiparticles, quantum tunnelling in these materials becomes highly anisotropic, qualitatively different from the case of normal, non-relativistic electrons. Massless Dirac fermions in graphene allow a close realization of Klein’s gedanken experiment, whereas massive chiral fermions in bilayer graphene offer an interesting complementary system that elucidates the basic physics involved.},

For such values of Z screening of the impurity charge and resonance scattering of holes are also considered.},

It is argued that the quantization of this system necessarily contains highly extended quantum states and that populating and depopulating such states by interacting with the quantum system leads to long-ranged teleportation-like processes. Also leads to spontaneous violation of fermion parity symmetry. A quasi-realistic model consisting of a quantum wire embedded in a p-wave superconductor is discussed as an explicit example of a physical system with an isolated Majorana zero mode.},

	abstract = {Inducing magnetic orders in a topological insulator (TI) to break its time reversal symmetry has been predicted to reveal many exotic topological quantum phenomena. The manipulation of magnetic orders in a TI layer can play a key role in harnessing these quantum phenomena toward technological applications. Here we fabricated a thin magnetic TI ﬁlm on an antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator Cr2O3 layer and found that the magnetic moments of the magnetic TI layer and the surface spins of the Cr2O3 layers favor interfacial AFM coupling. Field cooling studies show a crossover from negative to positive exchange bias clarifying the competition between the interfacial AFM coupling energy and the Zeeman energy in the AFM insulator layer. The interfacial exchange coupling also enhances the Curie temperature of the magnetic TI layer. The unique interfacial AFM alignment in magnetic TI on AFM insulator heterostructures opens a new route toward manipulating the interplay between topological states and magnetic orders in spin-engineered heterostructures, facilitating the exploration of proof-ofconcept TI-based spintronic and electronic devices with multifunctionality and low power consumption.},

Conductance and MR for parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) magnetic gap configurations are obtained and discussed. The results of MR reveal a significant negative value for maximum magnetic gap at z = (n + 3/4)π (n = 0, 1...), i.e., in smaller insulator barrier strengths in the presence of an external electric field, while it appears at z = nπ (n = 1, 2...) without electric field in Ref. Linder et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 104:067001, 2010 (z is the barrier strength). Also, we have found that maximum transmission probability (TP) increases with magnetic gap in the presence of electric field which is one for P case in z = (n + 1/6)π and approaches to one for induced magnetic gap near the Fermi energy for AP case in the absence of electric field and z = (n + 1/2)π . Finally, the conductance and MR oscillate with the magnetic gap and barrier strength.},

	abstract = {Inducing magnetism into topological insulators is intriguing for utilizing exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall eﬀect (QAHE) for technological applications. While most studies have focused on doping magnetic impurities to open a gap at the surface-state Dirac point, many undesirable eﬀects have been reported to appear in some cases that makes it diﬃcult to determine whether the gap opening is due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking or not. Furthermore, the realization of the QAHE has been limited to low temperatures. Here we have succeeded in generating a massive Dirac cone in a MnBi2Se4/Bi2Se3 heterostructure, which was fabricated by self-assembling a MnBi2Se4 layer on top of the Bi2Se3 surface as a result of the codeposition of Mn and Se. Our experimental results, supported by relativistic ab initio calculations, demonstrate that the fabricated MnBi2Se4/Bi2Se3 heterostructure shows ferromagnetism up to room temperature and a clear Dirac cone gap opening of ∼100 meV without any other signiﬁcant changes in the rest of the band structure. It can be considered as a result of the direct interaction of the surface Dirac cone and the magnetic layer rather than a magnetic proximity eﬀect. This spontaneously formed self-assembled heterostructure with a massive Dirac spectrum, characterized by a nontrivial Chern number C = −1, has a potential to realize the QAHE at signiﬁcantly higher temperatures than reported up to now and can serve as a platform for developing future “topotronics” devices.},

	abstract = {A possible sighting of Majorana states
Nearly 80 years ago, the Italian physicist Ettore Majorana proposed the existence of an unusual type of particle that is its own antiparticle, the so-called Majorana fermion. The search for a free Majorana fermion has so far been unsuccessful, but bound Majorana-like collective excitations may exist in certain exotic superconductors. Nadj-Perge et al. created such a topological superconductor by depositing iron atoms onto the surface of superconducting lead, forming atomic chains (see the Perspective by Lee). They then used a scanning tunneling microscope to observe enhanced conductance at the ends of these chains at zero energy, where theory predicts Majorana states should appear.
Science, this issue p. 602; see also p. 547
Majorana fermions are predicted to localize at the edge of a topological superconductor, a state of matter that can form when a ferromagnetic system is placed in proximity to a conventional superconductor with strong spin-orbit interaction. With the goal of realizing a one-dimensional topological superconductor, we have fabricated ferromagnetic iron (Fe) atomic chains on the surface of superconducting lead (Pb). Using high-resolution spectroscopic imaging techniques, we show that the onset of superconductivity, which gaps the electronic density of states in the bulk of the Fe chains, is accompanied by the appearance of zero-energy end-states. This spatially resolved signature provides strong evidence, corroborated by other observations, for the formation of a topological phase and edge-bound Majorana fermions in our atomic chains.
Scanning tunneling microscopy is used to observe signatures of Majorana states at the ends of iron atom chains. [Also see Perspective by Lee]

	abstract = {The surface of superconducting topological insulators (STIs) has been recognized as an eﬀective p ± ip superconductivity platform for realizing elusive Majorana fermions. Chiral Majorana modes (CMMs), which are diﬀerent from Majorana bound states localized at point defects, possess many exotic properties. Here we predict that CMMs can be achieved in experiments by depositing a ferromagnetic insulator overlayer on top of the STI surface. We simulate this heterostructure by employing a realistic tight-binding model and show that the CMM appears on the edge of the ferromagnetic islands and can be directly probed by STM only after the superconducting gap is inverted by the exchange coupling between the ferromagnet and the STI. In addition, multiple CMMs can be generated by tuning the chemical potential of the topological insulator. These results can be applied to both proximity-eﬀect–induced superconductivity in topological insulators and intrinsic STI compounds such as PbTaSe2, BiPd and their chemical analogues, providing a route to engineering CMMs in those materials.},

We ﬁnd that, Majorana mode energy, as a veriﬁed feature of TI F/S structure, along the interface sensitively depends on the magnitude of magnetization mzfs in FS region, while its slope in perpendicular incidence presents steep and no change. Since the superconducting gap is renormalized by a factor η (mzfs), hence Andreev reﬂection is more or less suppressed, and, in particular, resulting subgap tunneling conductance is more sensitive to the magnitude of magnetizations in FS and F regions. Furthermore, an interesting scenario happens at the antiparallel conﬁguration of magnetizations mzf and mzfs resulting in magnetoresistance in N/F/FS junction, which can be controlled and decreased by tuning the magnetization magnitude in FS region.},

However, the observed anomalous Hall resistance has never been more than several ohms, presumably owing to the interfacial disorders caused by the structural and chemical mismatch. Here, we show that, by growing (BixSb1−x)2Te3 (BST) thin ﬁlms on structurally and chemically well-matched, ferromagnetic-insulating CrGeTe3 (CGT) substrates, the proximityinduced anomalous Hall resistance can be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude.

	abstract = {The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is an exotic quantum phenomenon originating from dissipationless chiral channels at the sample edge. While the QAHE has been observed in magnetically doped topological insulators (TIs), exploiting the magnetic proximity effect on the TI surface from adjacent ferromagnetic layers may provide an alternative approach to the QAHE by opening an exchange gap with less disorder than that in the doped system. Nevertheless, the engineering of a favorable heterointerface that realizes the QAHE based on the magnetic proximity effect remains to be achieved. Here, we report on the observation of the QAHE in a proximity coupled system of a nonmagnetic TI and a ferromagnetic insulator (FMI). We have designed sandwich heterostructures of (Zn,Cr)Te/(Bi,Sb)2Te3/(Zn,Cr)Te that fulﬁlls two prerequisites for the emergence of the QAHE: the formation of a sizable exchange gap at the TI surface state and the tuning of the Fermi energy into the exchange gap. The efﬁcient proximity coupling in the all-telluride based heterostructure as demonstrated here will enable a realistic design of versatile tailor-made topological materials coupled with ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, and so on.},

Here we report a comprehensive investigation on the growth behaviors of prototype topological insulator Bi2Se3 thin ﬁlm on a single-crystalline LaCoO3 thin ﬁlm on SrTiO3 substrate, which is a strain-induced ferromagnetic insulator. Different from the growth on other substrates, the Bi2Se3 ﬁlms with highest quality on LaCoO3 favor a relatively low substrate temperature during growth. As a result, an inverse dependence of carrier mobility with the substrate temperature is found. Moreover, the magnetoresistance and coherence length of weak antilocalization also have a similar inverse dependence with the substrate temperature, as revealed by the magnetotransport measurements. Our experiments elucidate the special behaviors in Bi2Se3/LaCoO3 heterostructures, which provide a good platform for exploring related novel quantum phenomena, and are inspiring for device applications.},

Moreover, the unusual coupling between topological insulators and ferromagnets can also result in the formation of topological spin textures in the ferromagnetic layer. Skyrmions are topologically protected magnetization swirls that are promising candidates for spintronics memory carriers. Here, we report on the observation of skyrmionium in thin ferromagnetic ﬁlms coupled to a magnetic topological insulator. The occurrence of skyrmionium, which appears as a soliton composed of two skyrmions with opposite winding numbers, is tied to the ferromagnetic state of the topological insulator. Our work presents a new combination of two important classes of topological materials and may open the door to new topologically inspired information-storage concepts in the future.},

The topological properties and surface states of materials like bismuth selenide are protected by time-reversal symmetry, so it is crucial to understand how phenomena like ferromagnetism that break this symmetry will affect these states. Joon Sue Lee and collaborators from the Pennsylvania State University have created a device consisting of a topological insulator thin film grown on top of a ferromagnetic layer with tightly controlled doping in both layers. Quantum transport measurements show that the exchange interactions from the ferromagnet create a gap in the surface states at the interface while the far surface of the topological insulator remains gapless. Similar devices will enable detailed study of the fundamental role of symmetries in topological materials.},

The realization of these applications relies critically on the preparation and properties understanding of high-quality topological insulators, which however are mainly fabricated by high-cost methods like molecular beam epitaxy. We here report the successful preparation of high-quality topological insulator Bi2Se3/Si heterostructure having an atomically abrupt interface by van der Waals epitaxy growth of Bi2Se3 films on Si wafer. A simple, low-cost physical vapor deposition (PVD) method was employed to achieve the growth of the Bi2Se3 films. The Bi2Se3/Si heterostructure exhibited excellent diode characteristics with a pronounced photoresponse under light illumination. The built-in potential at the Bi2Se3/Si interface greatly facilitated the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers, enabling the photodetector to have a high light responsivity of 24.28 A W–1, a high detectivity of 4.39 × 1012 Jones (Jones = cm Hz1/2 W–1), and a fast response speed of aproximately microseconds. These device parameters represent the highest values for topological insulator-based photodetectors. Additionally, the photodetector possessed broadband detection ranging from ultraviolet to optical telecommunication wavelengths. Given the simple device architecture and compatibility with silicon technology, the topological insulator Bi2Se3/Si heterostructure holds great promise for high-performance electronic and optoelectronic applications.},

Recent theoretical calculations and photoemission spectroscopy measurements show that group V−VI materials Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are TIs with a single Dirac cone on the surface. These materials have anisotropic, layered structures, in which five atomic layers are covalently bonded to form a quintuple layer, and quintuple layers interact weakly through van der Waals interaction to form the crystal. A few quintuple layers of these materials are predicted to exhibit interesting surface properties. Different from our previous nanoribbon study, here we report the synthesis and characterizations of ultrathin Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 nanoplates with thickness down to 3 nm (3 quintuple layers), via catalyst-free vapor−solid (VS) growth mechanism. Optical images reveal thickness-dependent color and contrast for nanoplates grown on oxidized silicon (300 nm SiO2/Si). As a new member of TI nanomaterials, ultrathin TI nanoplates have an extremely large surface-to-volume ratio and can be electrically gated more effectively than the bulk form, potentially enhancing surface state effects in transport measurements. Low-temperature transport measurements of a single nanoplate device, with a high-k dielectric top gate, show decrease in carrier concentration by several times and large tuning of chemical potential.},

	abstract = {Nanostructures are not only attractive for fundamental research but also offer great promise for bottom-up nanofabrications. In the past, the growth of one-dimensional vertical/planar nanomaterials such as nanowires has made significant progresses. However, works on two-dimensional nanomaterials are still lacking, especially for those grown out of a substrate. We report here a vertical growth of topological insulator, Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, nanoplates on mica. In stark contrast to the general belief, these nanoplates are not prisms exposing (100) lateral surfaces, which are expected to minimize the surface area. Instead, they are frustums, enclosed by (01-4), (015), and (001) facets. First-principles calculations, combined with experiments, suggest the importance of surface oxidation in forming these unexpected surfaces.},

	abstract = {Effects induced by a topological insulator Bi2Se3 on the magnetic properties of an adjacent GaMnAs ﬁlm have been investigated using transport measurements. We observed three conspicuous effects in the GaMnAs layer induced by the proximity of the Bi2Se3 overlayer. First, our resistivity data as a function of temperature show that the GaMnAs layer adjacent to the Bi2Se3 displayed strongly metallic behavior, as compared with the GaMnAs control specimen. Second, the Curie temperature of the GaMnAs in the bilayer was observed to be higher than that of the control layer, in our case by nearly a factor of two. Finally, we observed signiﬁcant changes in the in-plane magnetic anisotropy of the GaMnAs in the bilayer, in the form of much higher values of both cubic and uniaxial anisotropy parameters. This latter feature manifests itself in a rather spectacular increase of the coercive ﬁeld observed in magnetization reversal across the in-plane hard axis. These results suggest that proximity of an adjacent Bi2Se3 layer represents an important tool for modifying and controlling the ferromagnetic properties of GaMnAs ﬁlm, and could thus be used to optimize this and similar materials for applications in spintronic devices.},

	abstract = {The control of recently observed spintronic eﬀects in topological-insulator/ferromagnetic-metal (TI/FM) heterostructures is thwarted by the lack of understanding of band structure and spin textures around their interfaces. Here we combine density functional theory with Green’s function techniques to obtain the spectral function at any plane passing through atoms of Bi2Se3 and Co or Cu layers comprising the interface. Instead of naively assumed Dirac cone gapped by the proximity exchange ﬁeld spectral function, we ﬁnd that the Rashba ferromagnetic model describes the spectral function on the surface of Bi2Se3 in contact with Co near the Fermi level E0F, where circular and snowﬂake-like constant energy contours coexist around which spin locks to momentum. The remnant of the Dirac cone is hybridized with evanescent wave functions from metallic layers and pushed, due to charge transfer from Co or Cu layers, a few tenths of an electron-volt below EF0 for both Bi2Se3/Co and Bi2Se3/Cu interfaces while hosting distorted helical spin texture wounding around a single circle. These features explain recent observation of sensitivity of spin-to-charge conversion signal at TI/Cu interface to tuning of EF0. Crucially for spin−orbit torque in TI/FM heterostructures, few monolayers of Co adjacent to Bi2Se3 host spectral functions very diﬀerent from the bulk metal, as well as in-plane spin textures (despite Co magnetization being out-of-plane) due to proximity spin−orbit coupling in Co induced by Bi2Se3. We predict that out-of-plane tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance in Cu/Bi2Se3/Co vertical heterostructure can serve as a sensitive probe of the type of spin texture residing at E0F.},

	abstract = {Time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking of the topological insulators (TIs) is a prerequisite to observe the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and topological magnetoelectric effect (TME). Although antiferromagnetism as well as ferromagnetism could break the TRS and generate massive Dirac surface states in the TIs, no attention has been paid to the antiferromagnet-TI heterostructures. Herein, we report the magnetotransport measurements of Bi2Se3 proximately coupled to antiferromagnetic NiO. Thin films of Bi2Se3 were successfully grown on the NiO (001) single crystalline substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. Unexpectedly, we observed a strong suppression of the weak antilocalization effect, which is similar to the case of TIs coupled to the ferromagnetic materials. For the 5 nm-thick Bi2Se3 sample on NiO, we even observed a crossover to weak localization at 2 K. These behaviors are attributed to the strong magnetic exchange field from the Ni 3d electrons. Our results show the effectiveness of the antiferromagnetic materials in breaking the TRS of TIs by the proximity effect and their possible applications for QAHE and TME observations.},

	abstract = {Exploration of novel electromagnetic phenomena is a subject of great interest in topological quantum materials. One of the unprecedented effects to be experimentally verified is the topological magnetoelectric (TME) effect originating from an unusual coupling of electric and magnetic fields in materials. A magnetic heterostructure of topological insulator (TI) hosts such exotic magnetoelectric coupling and can be expected to realize the TME effect as an axion insulator. We designed a magnetic TI with a tricolor structure where a nonmagnetic layer of (Bi, Sb)2Te3 is sandwiched by a soft ferromagnetic Cr-doped (Bi, Sb)2Te3 and a hard ferromagnetic V-doped (Bi, Sb)2Te3. Accompanied by the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect, we observe zero Hall conductivity plateaus, which are a hallmark of the axion insulator state, in a wide range of magnetic fields between the coercive fields of Cr- and V-doped layers. The resistance of the axion insulator state reaches as high as 109 ohms, leading to a gigantic magnetoresistance ratio exceeding 10,000,000\% upon the transition from the QAH state. The tricolor structure of the TI may not only be an ideal arena for the topologically distinct phenomena but can also provide magnetoresistive applications for advancing dissipation-less topological electronics.
Gigantic magnetoresistance is shown in a Cr- and V-doped topological insulator multilayer, assuring robust axion insulator.

	abstract = {The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) that emerges under broken time-reversal symmetry in topological insulators (TIs) exhibits many fascinating physical properties for potential applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics. However, in transition metal–doped TIs, the only experimentally demonstrated QAHE system to date, the QAHE is lost at practically relevant temperatures. This constraint is imposed by the relatively low Curie temperature (Tc) and inherent spin disorder associated with the random magnetic dopants. We demonstrate drastically enhanced Tc by exchange coupling TIs to Tm3Fe5O12, a high-Tc magnetic insulator with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Signatures showing that the TI surface states acquire robust ferromagnetism are revealed by distinct squared anomalous Hall hysteresis loops at 400 K. Point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy confirms that the TI surface is spin-polarized. The greatly enhanced Tc, absence of spin disorder, and perpendicular anisotropy are all essential to the occurrence of the QAHE at high temperatures.
Topological surface states reveal proximity-induced ferromagnetism with perpendicular anisotropy persisting above 400 K.

The evolution of the resulting hybrid AHE intensity with the top Bi2Te3 layer thickness manifests the presence of an intrinsic ferromagnetic phase induced by the topological surface states at the heterolayer interface. More importantly, by doping the Bi2Te3 layer with Sb, we are able to manipulate the sign of the Berry phase-associated AHE component. Our results demonstrate the unparalleled advantages of MTI heterostructures over magnetically doped TI counterparts in which the tunability of the AHE response can be greatly enhanced. This in turn unveils a new avenue for MTI heterostructure-based multifunctional applications.},

In a quantum anomalous Hall insulator, spontaneous magnetic moments and spin-orbit coupling combine to give rise to a topologically nontrivial electronic structure, leading to the quantized Hall effect without an external magnetic field. Based on first-principles calculations, we predict that the tetradymite semiconductors Bi2Te3, Bi2Se3, and Sb2Te3 form magnetically ordered insulators when doped with transition metal elements (Cr or Fe), in contrast to conventional dilute magnetic semiconductors where free carriers are necessary to mediate the magnetic coupling. In two-dimensional thin films, this magnetic order gives rise to a topological electronic structure characterized by a finite Chern number, with the Hall conductance quantized in units of e2/h (where e is the charge of an electron and h is Planck’s constant).
Magnetically doped topological insulators are predicted to be ferromagnetic and exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect.

	abstract = {Atomically-flat thin films of ferrimagnetic insulator Tb3Fe5O12 (TbIG) were grown on (111)-oriented Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG) substrates by pulsed laser deposition. Magnetic measurements indicated the easy magnetic axis of TbIG film was out-of-plane, as a result of the substrate-induced compressive in-plane strain within the film. The temperature dependence of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in Pt/TbIG bilayer was systematically studied with the applied magnetic field normal to the film plane, with square hysteresis AHE loops being observed. Reversal of AHE sign occurred twice between 10 K and room temperature, one at 50 K and another around 220 K, the latter of which was accompanied by complex magnetization switching behavior. The peculiar behavior of AHE loop around 220 K is closely related to the compensation point of TbIG. On the other hand, the sign change at 50 K was attributed to the modification of Pt electronic structure by TbIG. Our results highlight the relation between the AHE of Pt and magnetic properties of TbIG, which can be used for probing the magnetism in TbIG.},

Separation of the YIG ﬁlm from the GGG substrate by a metal ﬁlm strongly affects the crystalline structure of YIG and its magnetic damping. Despite the presence of structural defects, however, the YIG ﬁlms exhibit a clear ferromagnetic resonance response. The ability to tune the magnetic damping without substantial changes to magnetization offers attractive prospects for the design of complex spin-wave conduits. We show that the insertion of a 1-nm-thick metal layer between YIG and GGG already increases the effective damping parameter enough to efﬁciently absorb spin waves. This bilayer structure can therefore be utilized for magnonic waveguide termination. Investigating the dispersionless propagation of spin-wave packets, we demonstrate that a damping unit consisting of the YIG/metal bilayers can dissipate incident spin-wave signals with reﬂection coefﬁcient R {\textless} 0.1 at a distance comparable to the spatial width of the wave packet.},

Enhanced thermoelectric properties of these new materials through thermal conductivity reduction and electrical properties enhancement strategies such as nano-structuring and band engineering have also been reported. Nevertheless, the material system upon which all new thermoelectric material developments are compared with continues to be alloys of Bi2Te3. Approaches for thermoelectric property enhancements for Bi2Te3 alloys have also been undertaken, however, oriented polycrystalline materials continue to be of primary interest for thermoelectric device development. To this end we investigate n and p-type Bi2Te3 alloys provided by II-VI Inc. in order to elucidate the texturing in these materials and their transport properties with texturing. These materials are highly textured, as required in order to maximize the thermoelectric properties, with an 80\% enhancement of the thermoelectric properties obtained with texturing.},

No difference was observed between layers deposited on Si(100) and on Si(111): the layers were not sensitive to the initial orientation of silicon. The electrical measurements performed at room temperature show that the quality of layers deposited on SiO2 was better than the quality of layers deposited on Si(100) and Si(111). The figure of merit obtained in the case of the SiO2 substrate was Z = 1.9 × 10−3K−1, which is close to those reported for the monocrystal.

	abstract = {Multi-quantum-well structures of Bi2Te3 are predicted to have a high thermoelectric figure of merit ZT. Bi2Te3 thin films and Bi2Te3∕Bi2(Te0.88Se0.12)3 superlattices (SLs) were grown epitaxially by molecular beam epitaxy on BaF2 substrates with periods of 12 and 6nm, respectively. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction confirmed a layer-by-layer growth, x-ray diffraction yielded the lattice parameters and SL periods and proved epitaxial growth. The in-plane transport coefficients were measured and the thin films and SL had power factors between 28 and 35μW∕cmK2. The lattice thermal conductivity varied between 1.60W∕mK for Bi2Te3 thin films and 1.01W∕mK for a 10nm SL. The best figures of merit ZT were achieved for the SL; however, the values are slightly smaller than those in bulk materials. Thin films and superlattices were investigated in plan view and cross section by transmission electron microscopy. In the Bi2Te3 thin film and SL the dislocation density was found to be 2×1010cm−2. Bending of the SL with amplitudes of 30nm (12nm SL) and 15nm (6nm SL) and a wavelength of 400nm was determined. Threading dislocations were found with a density greater than 2×109cm−2. The superlattice interfaces are strongly bent in the region of the threading dislocations, undisturbed regions have a maximum lateral sie of 500nm. Thin films and SL showed a structural modulation [natural nanostructure (nns)] with a wavelength of 10nm and a wave vector parallel to (1,0,10). This nns was also observed in Bi2Te3 bulk materials and turned out to be of general character for Bi2Te3. The effect of the microstructure on the thermoelectric properties is discussed. The microstructure is governed by the superlattice, the nns, and the dislocations that are present in the films. Our results indicate that the microstructure directly affects the lattice thermal conductivity. Thermopower and electrical conductivity were found to be negatively correlated and no clear dependence of the two quantities on the microstructure could be found.},

	abstract = {Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 thin films were grown at room temperature on SiO2 and BaF2 substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. A layer-by-layer growth was achieved such that metallic layers of the elements with 0.2nm thickness were deposited. The layer structure in the as-deposited films was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and was seen more clearly in Sb2Te3 thin films. Subsequent annealing was done at 250°C for 2h and produced the Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 crystal structure as confirmed by high-energy X-ray diffraction. This preparation process is referred to as nano-alloying and it was demonstrated to yield single-phase thin films of these compounds. In the thin films a significant texture could be identified with the crystal c axis being almost parallel to the growth direction for Sb2Te3 and tilted by about 30° for Bi2Te3 thin films. In-plane transport properties were measured for the annealed films at room temperature. Both films yielded a charge carrier density of about 2.6×1019cm−3. The Sb2Te3 films were p-type, had a thermopower of +130μVK−1, and surprisingly high mobilities of 402cm2V−1s−1. The Bi2Te3 films were n-type, showed a thermopower of −153μVK−1, and yielded significantly smaller mobilities of 80cm2V−1s−1. The chemical composition and microstructure of the films were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on cross sections of the thin films. The grain sizes were about 500nm for the Sb2Te3 and 250nm for the Bi2Te3 films. In the Bi2Te3 thin film, energy-filtered TEM allowed to image a Bi-rich grain boundary phase, several nanometers thick. This secondary phase explains the poor mobilities of the Bi2Te3 thin film. With these results the high potential of the nano-alloying deposition technique for growing films with a more complex layer architecture is demonstrated.},

A salient feature of this review is a critical comparison between carrier transport in graphene and in two-dimensional semiconductor systems (e.g., heterostructures, quantum wells, inversion layers) so that the unique features of graphene electronic properties arising from its gapless, massless, chiral Dirac spectrum are highlighted. Experiment and theory, as well as quantum and semiclassical transport, are discussed in a synergistic manner in order to provide a unified and comprehensive perspective. Although the emphasis of the review is on those aspects of graphene transport where reasonable consensus exists in the literature, open questions are discussed as well. Various physical mechanisms controlling transport are described in depth including long-range charged impurity scattering, screening, short-range defect scattering, phonon scattering, many-body effects, Klein tunneling, minimum conductivity at the Dirac point, electron-hole puddle formation, p−n junctions, localization, percolation, quantum-classical crossover, midgap states, quantum Hall effects, and other phenomena.},

For a thin slab of three-dimensional topological insulator, the boundary modes from the opposite surfaces may be coupled by quantum tunnelling, so that a small, thickness-dependent gap is opened up13,14,15. Here we report such results from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on Bi2Se3 films of various thicknesses grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The energy gap opening is clearly seen when the thickness is below six quintuple layers. The gapped surface states also exhibit sizeable Rashba-type spin–orbit splitting because of the substrate-induced potential difference between the two surfaces. The tunable gap and the spin–orbit coupling make these topological thin films ideal for electronic and spintronic device applications.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe∕CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1−xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

Here we investigate the effect of the dielectric environment of graphene and study electrical transport in multi-terminal graphene devices suspended in liquids with κ ranging from 1.9 to 33. For non-polar liquids (κ{\textless}5), we observe a rapid increase of μ(κ), with room-temperature mobility reaching {\textasciitilde}60,000 cm2 Vs−1 for devices in anisole (κ=4.3). We associate this trend with dielectric screening of charged impurities adsorbed on graphene. We observe much lower mobility μ{\textasciitilde}20,000 cm2 Vs−1 for devices in polar liquids (κ≥18) and explain it by additional scattering caused by ions present in such liquids.},

This review presents a pedagogical account on topological insulator materials with an emphasis on basic theory and materials properties. After presenting a historical perspective and basic theories of topological insulators, it discusses all the topological insulator materials discovered as of May 2013, with some illustrative descriptions of the developments in materials discoveries in which the author was involved. A summary is given for possible ways to confirm the topological nature in a candidate material. Various synthesis techniques as well as the defect chemistry that are important for realizing bulk-insulating samples are discussed. Characteristic properties of topological insulators are discussed with an emphasis on transport properties. In particular, the Dirac fermion physics and the resulting peculiar quantum oscillation patterns are discussed in detail. It is emphasized that proper analyses of quantum oscillations make it possible to unambiguously identify surface Dirac fermions through transport measurements. The prospects of topological insulator materials for elucidating novel quantum phenomena that await discovery conclude the review.},

	abstract = {Better Contact Along the Edge
Electrical contact to graphene is normally done with metal contacts on its flat face, where there are few strong bonding sites for the metal. Wang et al. (p. 614) encapsulated graphene with hexagonal boron nitride sheets and made metal contacts along its edge, where bonding orbitals are exposed. The resulting heterostructures had high electronic performance, with room-temperature carrier mobilities near the theoretical phonon-scattering limit.
Heterostructures based on layering of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride represent a new class of electronic devices. Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary 2D materials.
Metal contacts to graphene along its edge improve bonding and, in turn, electronic performance.

	abstract = {Recent demonstrations of magnetization switching induced by in-plane current in heavy metal/ferromagnetic heterostructures (HMFHs) have drawn great attention to spin torques arising from large spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Given the intrinsic strong SOC, topological insulators (TIs) are expected to be promising candidates for exploring spin–orbit torque (SOT)-related physics. Here we demonstrate experimentally the magnetization switching through giant SOT induced by an in-plane current in a chromium-doped TI bilayer heterostructure. The critical current density required for switching is below 8.9 × 104 A cm−2 at 1.9 K. Moreover, the SOT is calibrated by measuring the effective spin–orbit field using second-harmonic methods. The effective field to current ratio and the spin-Hall angle tangent are almost three orders of magnitude larger than those reported for HMFHs. The giant SOT and efficient current-induced magnetization switching exhibited by the bilayer heterostructure may lead to innovative spintronics applications such as ultralow power dissipation memory and logic devices.},

We discuss possible experimental measurements of the half-integer Hall conductance gxy of topological insulator surface states and explain how to reconcile Laughlin's flux insertion argument with half-integer gxy. Using a vortex state representation of Landau level wave functions, we calculate current density beyond linear response, which is in particular relevant to the topological image monopole effect. As a major result, the field theory describing the localization physics of the quantum Hall effect of a single species of Dirac fermions is derived. In this connection, the issue of (absent) parity anomaly is revisited. The renormalization group (RG) flow and the resulting phase diagram are extensively discussed. Starting values of the RG flow are given by the semiclassical conductivity tensor which is obtained from the Boltzmann transport theory of the anomalous Hall effect.},

Although significant progress has been made in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and epitaxial growth of graphene, the carrier mobility obtained with these techniques is still significantly lower than what is achieved using exfoliated graphene. We show that the quality of CVD-grown graphene depends critically on the used transfer process, and we report on an advanced transfer technique that allows both reusing the copper substrate of the CVD growth and making devices with mobilities as high as 350,000 cm2 V–1 s–1, thus rivaling exfoliated graphene.
A novel dry transfer technique opens the door to large-scale CVD graphene with carrier mobilities of up to several 100,000 cm2 V−1 s−1.

Our X-ray diﬀraction studies reveal a ﬁrst-order crystallographic phase transition occurring near 210−220 K upon warming, with signiﬁcant thermal hysteresis. The low-temperature structure is rhombohedral (R3̅, BiI3type) and the high-temperature structure is monoclinic (C2/ m, AlCl3-type). We ﬁnd evidence for coupling between the crystallographic and magnetic degrees of freedom in CrI3, observing an anomaly in the interlayer spacing at the Curie temperature and an anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility at the structural transition. First-principles calculations reveal the importance of proper treatment of the long-ranged interlayer forces, and van der Waals density functional theory does an excellent job of predicting the crystal structures and their relative stability. Calculations also suggest that the ferromagnetic order found in the bulk material may persist into monolayer form, suggesting that CrI3 and other chromium trihalides may be promising materials for spintronic and magnetoelectronic research.},

Here, we report a temperature-dependent electronic transport study on chemical vapor deposited-graphene gated with SrTiO3 (STO) thin film substrate. At carrier densities away from charge neutrality point the temperature-dependent resistivity of our graphene samples on both STO and SiO2/Si substrates show metallic behavior with contributions from Coulomb scattering and flexural phonons attributable to the presence of characteristic quasi-periodic nano-ripple arrays. Significantly, for graphene samples on STO substrates we observe an anomalous ‘slope-break’ in the temperature-dependent resistivity for T = 50 to 100 K accompanied by a decrease in mobility above 30 K. Furthermore, we observe an unusual decrease in the gate-induced doping-rate at low temperatures, despite an increase in dielectric constant of the substrate. We believe that a complex mechanism is at play as a consequence of the structural phase transition of the underlying substrate showing an anomalous transport behavior in graphene on STO. The anomalies are discussed in the context of Coulomb as well as phonon scattering.},

By systematically varying the Bi2Se3 film thickness, we show that the spin-charge conversion efficiency, characterized by the inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect length (λIREE), increases dramatically as the film thickness is increased from two quintuple layers, saturating above six quintuple layers. This suggests a dominant role of surface states in spin and charge interconversion in topological-insulator–ferromagnet heterostructures. Our conclusion is further corroborated by studying a series of Y3Fe5O12/(Bi,Sb)2Te3 heterostructures. Finally, we use the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth broadening and the inverse Rashba-Edelstein signals to determine the effective interfacial spin mixing conductance and λIREE.},

	abstract = {Since the discovery of graphene1, the family of two-dimensional materials has grown, displaying a broad range of electronic properties. Recent additions include semiconductors with spin–valley coupling2, Ising superconductors3,4,5 that can be tuned into a quantum metal6, possible Mott insulators with tunable charge-density waves7, and topological semimetals with edge transport8,9. However, no two-dimensional crystal with intrinsic magnetism has yet been discovered10,11,12,13,14; such a crystal would be useful in many technologies from sensing to data storage15. Theoretically, magnetic order is prohibited in the two-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model at finite temperatures by the Mermin–Wagner theorem16. Magnetic anisotropy removes this restriction, however, and enables, for instance, the occurrence of two-dimensional Ising ferromagnetism. Here we use magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy to demonstrate that monolayer chromium triiodide (CrI3) is an Ising ferromagnet with out-of-plane spin orientation. Its Curie temperature of 45 kelvin is only slightly lower than that of the bulk crystal, 61 kelvin, which is consistent with a weak interlayer coupling. Moreover, our studies suggest a layer-dependent magnetic phase, highlighting thickness-dependent physical properties typical of van der Waals crystals17,18,19. Remarkably, bilayer CrI3 displays suppressed magnetization with a metamagnetic effect20, whereas in trilayer CrI3 the interlayer ferromagnetism observed in the bulk crystal is restored. This work creates opportunities for studying magnetism by harnessing the unusual features of atomically thin materials, such as electrical control for realizing magnetoelectronics12, and van der Waals engineering to produce interface phenomena15.},

We present a theory of the spin-Seebeck signal in the case where the conductor that supports the voltage signal is the topologically protected two-dimensional surface-state system at the interface between a ferromagnetic insulator (FI) and a topological insulator (TI). Our theory uses a Dirac model for the TI surface states and assumes Heisenberg exchange coupling between the TI quasiparticles and the FI magnetization. The spin-Seebeck voltage is induced by the TI surface states scattering off the nonequilibrium magnon population at the surface of the semi-infinite thermally driven FI. Our theory is readily generalized to spin-Seebeck voltages in any two-dimensional conductor that is exchange-coupled to the surface of a FI. Surface-state carrier-density-dependent signal strengths calculated using Bi2Te3 and yttrium iron garnet material parameters are consistent with recent experiments.},

Here we report epitaxial growth of bulk insulating three-dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) Bi2–xSbxTe3–ySey (BSTS) ultrathin films, ranging from a few quintuple to several hundreds of layers, on mica in a large-area (1 cm2) via catalyst-free physical vapor deposition. These films can nondestructively be exfoliated using deionized water and transferred to various kinds of substrates as desired. The transferred BSTS thin films show good ambipolar characteristics as well as well-defined quantum oscillations arising from the topological surface states. The carrier mobility of 2500–5100 cm2/(V s) is comparable to the high-quality bulk BSTS single crystal. Moreover, tunable electronic states from the massless to the massive Dirac fermion were observed with a decrease in the film thickness. Both the feasible large-area synthesis and the reliable film transfer process can promise that BSTS ultrathin films will pave a route to many applications of 3D-TIs.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity—which cannot be explained by weak electron–phonon interactions—in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1°—the first ‘magic’ angle—the electronic band structure of this ‘twisted bilayer graphene’ exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature–carrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

One of the promising routes to inducing a magnetic order in a TI is utilizing magnetic proximity eﬀect between a TI and a strong magnetic insulator (MI). In this article, we demonstrate a TI/MI heterostructure prepared through transferring a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown Bi2Se3 ﬁlm onto a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) substrate via wet transfer. The transferred Bi2Se3 exhibits excellent quality over a large scale. Moreover, through wet transfer we are able to engineer the interface and perform a comparative study to probe the proximity coupling between Bi2Se3 and YIG under diﬀerent interface conditions. A detailed investigation of both the anomalous Hall eﬀect and quantum corrections to the conductivity in magnetotransport measurements reveals an induced magnetic order as well as TRS breaking in the transferred Bi2Se3 ﬁlm on YIG. In contrast, a thin layer of AlOx at the interface obstructs the proximity coupling and preserves the TRS, indicating the critical role of the interface in mediating magnetic proximity eﬀect.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators (TIs) host robust edge or surface states protected by time-reversal symmetry (TRS), which makes them prime candidates for applications in spintronic devices. A promising avenue of research for the development of functional TI devices has involved doping of three-dimensional (3D) TI thin film and bulk materials with magnetic elements. This approach aims to break the TRS and open a surface band gap near the Dirac point. Utilizing this gapped surface state allows for a wide range of novel physical effects to be observed, paving a way for applications in spintronics and quantum computation. This review focuses on the research of 3D TIs doped with manganese (Mn). We summarize major progress in the study of Mn doped chalcogenide TIs, including Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Bi2(Te,Se)3. The transport properties, in particular the anomalous Hall effect, of the Mn-doped Bi2Se3 are discussed in detail. Finally, we conclude with future prospects and challenges in further studies of Mn doped TIs.},

Strained-TmIG films with robust perpendicular magnetic anisotropy were deposited by off-axis sputtering. We demonstrated a streaky reflection high-energy electron diffraction pattern starting from the very first quintuple layer of Bi2Se3, indicating the high-quality interface between TmIG and Bi2Se3, a prerequisite for studying interfacial exchange coupling effects. The strong interfacial exchange interaction was manifested by the observation of an anomalous Hall effect in the Bi2Se3/TmIG bilayer and a shift of the ferromagnetic resonance field of TmIG induced by Bi2Se3. We have reproducibly grown high-quality Bi2Se3/ReIG and interfaces using this TI growth method, which may be applied to grow other types of van der Waals hetero-structures.},

	abstract = {For a long time we have shared the belief that the physics of the Hume-Rothery electron concentration rule can be deepened only through thorough investigation of the interference phenomenon of itinerant electrons with a particular set of lattice planes, regardless of whether d-states are involved near the Fermi level or not. For this purpose, we have developed the FLAPW-Fourier theory (Full potential Linearized Augmented Plane Wave), which is capable of determining the square of the Fermi diameter,        (  2  k F   )   2     , and the number of itinerant electrons per atom, e/a, as well as the set of lattice planes participating in the interference phenomenon. By determining these key parameters, we could test the interference condition and clarify how it contributes to the formation of a pseudogap at the Fermi level. Further significant progress has been made to allow us to equally handle transition metal (TM) elements and their compounds. A method of taking the center of gravity energy for energy distribution of electrons with a given electronic state has enabled us to eliminate the d-band anomaly and to determine effective        (  2  k F   )   2     , and e/a, even for systems involving the d-band or an energy gap across the Fermi level. The e/a values for 54 elements covering from Group 1 up to Group 16 in the Periodic Table, including 3d-, 4d- and 5d-elements, were determined in a self-consistent manner. The FLAPW-Fourier theory faces its limit only for elements in Group 17 like insulating solids Cl and their compounds, although the value of e/a can be determined without difficulty when Br becomes metallic under high pressures. The origin of a pseudogap at the Fermi level for a large number of compounds has been successfully interpreted in terms of the interference condition, regardless of the bond-types involved in the van Arkel-Ketelaar triangle map.},

In contrast to the conductivity of conventional two-dimensional materials, graphene's conductivity at the Dirac point is geometry-dependent because of conduction via evanescent modes, approaching the theoretical value 4e2/πh (where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant) only for short and wide devices. These distinctive transport properties have important implications for understanding chaotic quantum systems and implementing nanoelectronic devices, such as ballistic transistors.},

	abstract = {Currently 2D crystals are being studied intensively for use in future nanoelectronics, as conventional semiconductor devices face challenges in high power consumption and short channel effects when scaled to the quantum limit. Toward this end, achieving barrier-free contact to 2D semiconductors has emerged as a major roadblock. In conventional contacts to bulk metals, the 2D semiconductor Fermi levels become pinned inside the bandgap, deviating from the ideal Schottky–Mott rule and resulting in significant suppression of carrier transport in the device. Here, MoS2 polarity control is realized without extrinsic doping by employing a 1D elemental metal contact scheme. The use of high-work-function palladium (Pd) or gold (Au) enables a high-quality p-type dominant contact to intrinsic MoS2, realizing Fermi level depinning. Field-effect transistors (FETs) with Pd edge contact and Au edge contact show high performance with the highest hole mobility reaching 330 and 432 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 300 K, respectively. The ideal Fermi level alignment allows creation of p- and n-type FETs on the same intrinsic MoS2 flake using Pd and low-work-function molybdenum (Mo) contacts, respectively. This device acts as an efficient inverter, a basic building block for semiconductor integrated circuits, with gain reaching 15 at VD = 5 V.},

Fast-emerging two-dimensional (2D) materials with atomically flat surfaces, free of dangling bonds, are intuitively promising to form ohmic contacts with metals. However, the contacts of 2D devices usually possess a large Schottky barrier and rarely follow the Schottky-Mott rule, because of interfacial effects such as Fermi-level pinning. Herein, we summarize recent progress and developments in contact engineering of 2D materials for the realization of ohmic contacts in 2D electronic devices. The basic physics of contacts for both Si and 2D materials is briefly introduced. A variety of engineering strategies are subsequently introduced, including band matching, doping, phase engineering, insertion of buffer layers, 2D/metal van der Waals contacts, and edge contacts. Finally, opportunities and challenges for optimizing contacts for future 2D electronics are discussed.},

	abstract = {Advanced beyond-silicon electronic technology requires both channel materials and also ultralow-resistance contacts to be discovered1,2. Atomically thin two-dimensional semiconductors have great potential for realizing high-performance electronic devices1,3. However, owing to metal-induced gap states (MIGS)4–7, energy barriers at the metal–semiconductor interface—which fundamentally lead to high contact resistance and poor current-delivery capability—have constrained the improvement of two-dimensional semiconductor transistors so far2,8,9. Here we report ohmic contact between semimetallic bismuth and semiconducting monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) where the MIGS are sufficiently suppressed and degenerate states in the TMD are spontaneously formed in contact with bismuth. Through this approach, we achieve zero Schottky barrier height, a contact resistance of 123 ohm micrometres and an on-state current density of 1,135 microamps per micrometre on monolayer MoS2; these two values are, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest and highest yet recorded, respectively. We also demonstrate that excellent ohmic contacts can be formed on various monolayer semiconductors, including MoS2, WS2 and WSe2. Our reported contact resistances are a substantial improvement for two-dimensional semiconductors, and approach the quantum limit. This technology unveils the potential of high-performance monolayer transistors that are on par with state-of-the-art three-dimensional semiconductors, enabling further device downscaling and extending Moore’s law.},

RC is sensitive to the quality of the interface and the composition of the contact, which are affected by the graphene transfer process and contact deposition conditions. In this work, a linear correlation is observed between the composition of Ti contacts, characterized by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the Ti/graphene contact resistance measured by the transfer length method. We find that contact composition is tunable via deposition rate and base pressure. Reactor base pressure is found to effect the resultant contact resistance. The effect of contact deposition conditions on thermal transport measured by time-domain thermoreflectance is also reported. Interfaces with higher oxide composition appear to result in a lower thermal boundary conductance. Possible origins of this thermal boundary conductance change with oxide composition are discussed.},

Here, we report the observation of weak anti-localization and quantum oscillations originated from surface states in Bi2Se2Te crystals. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on cleaved Bi2Se2Te crystals show a well-defined linear dispersion without intersection of the conduction band. The measured weak anti-localization effect agrees well with the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka model and the extracted phase coherent length shows a power-law dependence with temperature (∼T−0.44), indicating the presence of the surface states. More importantly, the analysis of a Landau-level fan diagram of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations yields a finite Berry phase of ∼0.42π, suggesting the Dirac nature of the surface states. Our results demonstrate that Bi2Se2Te can serve as a suitable topological insulator candidate for achieving intrinsic quantum transport of surface Dirac fermions.},

In particular, the crossover from weak antilocalization to weak localization in the bulk states is observed in the parallel magnetic field measurements up to 50 Tesla. The measured magneto-resistance exhibits interesting anisotropy with respect to the orientation of parallel magnetic field B// and the current I, signifying intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in the Bi2Se3 films. Our work directly shows the crossover of quantum interference effect in the bulk states from weak antilocalization to weak localization.

	abstract = {Weak localization and weak anti-localization are quantum interference eﬀects in quantum transport in a disordered electron system. Weak anti-localization enhances the conductivity and weak localization suppresses the conductivity with decreasing temperature at very low temperatures. A magnetic ﬁeld can destroy the quantum interference eﬀect, giving rise to a cusp-like positive and negative magnetoconductivity as the signatures of weak localization and weak anti-localization, respectively. These eﬀects have been widely observed in topological insulators. In this article, we review recent progresses in both theory and experiment of weak (anti-)localization in topological insulators, where the quasiparticles are described as Dirac fermions. We predicted a crossover from weak anti-localization to weak localization if the massless Dirac fermions (such as the surface states of topological insulator) acquire a Dirac mass, which was conﬁrmed experimentally. The bulk states in a topological insulator thin ﬁlm can exhibit the weak localization eﬀect, quite diﬀerent from other system with strong spinorbit interaction. We compare the localization behaviors of Dirac fermions with conventional electron systems in the presence of disorders of diﬀerent symmetries. Finally, we show that both the interaction and quantum interference are required to account for the experimentally observed temperature and magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the conductivity at low temperatures.},

The theoretical focus is on longitudinal transport in the presence of an electric field, including Boltzmann transport, quantum corrections and weak localization, as well as longitudinal and Hall transport in the presence of both electric and magnetic fields and/or magnetizations. Special attention is paid to transport at finite doping, and to the π-Berry phase, which leads to the absence of backscattering, Klein tunneling and half-quantized Hall response. Signatures of surface states in ordinary transport and magnetotransport are identified. The review also covers transport experiments of the past years, tracing its evolution from the initial obscuring of surface transport by bulk transport to the increasing success of experimental work in identifying transport due to the surface states. Current and likely future experimental challenges are given prominence and the present status of the field is assessed.},

The proposed applications of topological insulators in device geometries rely on the ability to tune the chemical potential on their surfaces in the vicinity of the Dirac node. Here, we demonstrate a suite of surface control methods based on a combination of photo-doping and molecular-doping to systematically tune the Dirac fermion density on the topological (111) surface of Bi2Te3. Their efficacy is demonstrated via direct electronic structure topology measurements using high resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). These results open up new opportunities for probing topological behavior of Dirac electrons on the Bi2Te3 surface. At least one of the methods demonstrated here can be successfully applied to other topological insulators such as the Bi\{1-x\}Sb\{x\}, Sb2Te3 and Bi2Se3 which will be shown elsewhere. More importantly, our methods of topological surface state manipulation demonstrated here are highly suitable for future spectroscopic studies of topological phenomena which will complement the transport results gained from the traditional electrical gating techniques.},

The longitudinal resistivity of the porous samples became more metallic, indicating the increased surface area resulted in transport that was more surfacelike. Weak antilocalization was present in all samples, and remarkably the phase coherence length doubled in the porous samples. This increase is likely due to the large Fermi velocity of the Dirac surface states. Our results show that the introduction of nanoporosity does not destroy the topological surface states but rather enhances them, making these nanostructured materials promising for low energy electronics, spintronics and thermoelectrics.},

It was found that the magnetoconductance of these nanowires in low field regime can be well described by one-dimensional (1D) weak antilocalization (WAL) model, where the dephasing length of the electrons follows T−1/3 dependence but insensitive to the wire diameter. Meanwhile, such a 1D surface WAL was found to be enhanced significantly with the decrease of the wire diameter.},

A non-saturating positive MR is observed in the perpendicular fields (B⊥I), while an evident negative MR is observed in the parallel fields (B//I). Both the positive MR and negative MR show a linear magnetic field dependence at high magnetic fields (B \&gt; 8 T). In addition, two types of carriers are extracted from the nonlinear Hall resistance measurements, which are attributed to the Bi2Se3 bulk electrons and the electron accumulation layer at the surface or Bi2Se3/SiO2 interface, respectively. The conductivity fluctuations in the accumulation layer are believed to be the origin for the observation of positive MR in the perpendicular fields and negative MR in the parallel fields with linear and non-saturating characteristics.},

The mean value obtained is b (Tb) = 0.735(10) x 10−12 cm. Furthermore the positional and thermal parameters of TbIG have been refined from single crystal X-ray and neutron powder data. The results from both experiments agree well. The X-ray data from a sphere of diameter φ = 282μm were collected by MoKα radiation. The refinement was carried out including an extinction parameter which was also applied to correct for anomalous transmission. The powder data were treated by the profile analysis technique where the structural parameters and the magnetic moments were refined simultaneously. Two slightly different form factor curves were applied for Fe3+ in the crystallographic sites. The magnetic moments for the iron ions were found to be μ = 3.69(10)μB for the octahedral and 3.65(10)μB for the tetrahedral site at room temperature. The moment for terbium is μ = 1.15(09)μB and the whole magnetisation for one formula unit is 0.12(0.40)μB. The observed moments of Fe3+ are considerably reduced as compared to the free ion spin only value which was calculated from a Brillouin function for S = 52 to be 4.34μBat 300 K.},

The devices are fabricated from high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in which quasi-one-dimensional wires are defined by electrostatic gates. These devices enable measurements of local and nonlocal transport properties and have been optimized via extensive simulations to ensure robustness against nonuniformity and disorder. Our main result is that several devices, fabricated according to the design's engineering specifications, have passed the topological gap protocol defined in Pikulin et al. (arXiv:2103.12217). This protocol is a stringent test composed of a sequence of three-terminal local and nonlocal transport measurements performed while varying the magnetic field, semiconductor electron density, and junction transparencies. Passing the protocol indicates a high probability of detection of a topological phase hosting Majorana zero modes as determined by large-scale disorder simulations. Our experimental results are consistent with a quantum phase transition into a topological superconducting phase that extends over several hundred millitesla in magnetic field and several millivolts in gate voltage, corresponding to approximately one hundred microelectronvolts in Zeeman energy and chemical potential in the semiconducting wire. These regions feature a closing and reopening of the bulk gap, with simultaneous zero-bias conductance peaks at both ends of the devices that withstand changes in the junction transparencies. The extracted maximum topological gaps in our devices are 20–60µeV. This demonstration is a prerequisite for experiments involving fusion and braiding of Majorana zero modes.},

While observation of exceptionally long spin relaxation lengths makes graphene an intriguing material for spintronics studies, electric field modulation of spin currents is almost impossible due to negligible intrinsic spin–orbit coupling of graphene. In this work, we create an artificial interface between monolayer graphene and few-layer semiconducting tungsten disulphide. In these devices, we observe that graphene acquires spin–orbit coupling up to 17 meV, three orders of magnitude higher than its intrinsic value, without modifying the structure of the graphene. The proximity spin–orbit coupling leads to the spin Hall effect even at room temperature, and opens the door to spin field effect transistors. We show that intrinsic defects in tungsten disulphide play an important role in this proximity effect and that graphene can act as a probe to detect defects in semiconducting surfaces.},

Ongoing research strives to explore interfacial interactions with other materials to engineer targeted electronic properties. Here we show that with a tungsten disulfide (WS2) substrate, the strength of the spin–orbit interaction (SOI) in graphene is very strongly enhanced. The induced SOI leads to a pronounced low-temperature weak anti-localization effect and to a spin-relaxation time two to three orders of magnitude smaller than in graphene on conventional substrates. To interpret our findings we have performed first-principle electronic structure calculations, which confirm that carriers in graphene on WS2 experience a strong SOI and allow us to extract a spin-dependent low-energy effective Hamiltonian. Our analysis shows that the use of WS2 substrates opens a possible new route to access topological states of matter in graphene-based systems.},

With decreasing thickness, the indirect band gap, which lies below the direct gap in the bulk material, shifts upwards in energy by more than 0.6 eV. This leads to a crossover to a direct-gap material in the limit of the single monolayer. Unlike the bulk material, the MoS2 monolayer emits light strongly.

Our ab initio calculations indicate that the band gap is direct, depends on the number of layers and the in-layer strain, and is significantly larger than the bulk value of 0.31–0.36 eV. The observed photoluminescence peak of single-layer phosphorene in the visible optical range confirms that the band gap is larger than that of the bulk system. Our transport studies indicate a hole mobility that reflects the structural anisotropy of phosphorene and complements n-type MoS2. At room temperature, our few-layer phosphorene field-effect transistors with 1.0 μm channel length display a high on-current of 194 mA/mm, a high hole field-effect mobility of 286 cm2/V·s, and an on/off ratio of up to 104. We demonstrate the possibility of phosphorene integration by constructing a 2D CMOS inverter consisting of phosphorene PMOS and MoS2 NMOS transistors.},

With increasingly negative gate voltage, a pronounced magnetoresistance of ∼100\% is observed, while the associated B-field dependence changes from quadratic to linear. Concomitantly, the resistance-versus-temperature curves evolve from metallic to semiconductor-like, and increasingly strong weak anti-localization behavior is manifested. Analysis of the magnetoresistance data reveals two contributions, namely from the bulk conduction band and from a state inside the bulk gap. The latter is responsible for the linear magnetoresistance and likely represents the topologically protected surface state.},

	abstract = {The presence of large linear magnetoresistance in a Bi2Se3 single crystal is reported. The magnetoresistance has quadratic form at low fields which crosses over to linear dependence above 4 T. The temperature dependence of magnetoresistance scales with carrier mobility and inverse of carrier concentration while the crossover field scales with inverse of mobility. The magnetoresistance scaling shows that fluctuations in carrier mobility and carrier concentration cause the linear magnetoresistance. This analysis suggests that scattering of charge carriers from neutral crystalline defects is the main source of mobility fluctuation. Further, the carrier concentration exhibits a strong temperature dependence which is attributed to the thermal activation of charge carriers from defect states having activation energy ≈13 meV.},

	abstract = {In chalcogenide topological insulator materials, two types of magnetoresistance (MR) effects are widely discussed: a sharp MR dip around zero magnetic field, associated with the weak antilocalization (WAL) effect, and a linear MR (LMR) effect that generally persists to high fields and high temperatures. We have studied the MR of thin films of the topological insulator Bi2Te3 from the metallic to semiconducting transport regime. In the metallic samples, the WAL is difficult to identify owing to the low magnitude of the WAL compared to the samples’ conductivity. Furthermore, the sharp WAL dip in the MR is clearly present in samples with a higher resistivity. To correctly account for the low-field MR with the quantitative theory of the WAL according to the Hikami–Larkin–Nagaoka (HLN) model, we find that the classical (linear) MR effect should be taken into account in combination with the WAL quantum correction. Otherwise, the WAL fitting alone yields an unrealistically large coefficient α in the HLN analysis. This work clarifies the WAL and LMR as two distinct effects and offers an explanation for the overly large α in the WAL analysis of topological insulators in some studies.},

The STO layer is used to mediate and tune the range of interactions between the ferromagnet and superconductor. A magnetically depleted layer with zero-magnetisation within the LCMO layer is shown by polarised neutron reflectometry measurements. This zero-magnetisation layer is caused by the onset of superconductivity in YBCO despite being separated by an insulating layer with a thickness much larger than the superconducting coherence length. The magnetic field dependence of this interaction is also explored. We show that the magnetism of the depleted layer can be restored by applying a magnetic field that partially destroys the superconductivity in YBCO, restricting the electronic interaction between the materials.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate robust interface strain-induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in atomically flat ferrimagnetic insulator Tm3Fe5O12 (TIG) films grown with pulsed laser deposition on a substituted Gd3Ga5O12 substrate which maximizes the tensile strain at the interface. In bilayers consisting of Pt and TIG, we observe large squared Hall hysteresis loops over a wide range of thicknesses of Pt at room temperature. When a thin Cu layer is inserted between Pt and TIG, the Hall hysteresis magnitude decays but stays finite as the thickness of Cu increases up to 5 nm. However, if the Cu layer is placed atop Pt instead, the Hall hysteresis magnitude is consistently larger than when the Cu layer with the same thickness is inserted in between for all Cu thicknesses. These results suggest that both the proximity-induced ferromagnetism and spin current contribute to the anomalous Hall effect.},

	abstract = {A review of magnon properties of yttrium-iron garnet (YIG), a classical object for experimental studies in magnetism, is presented. Both experimental and theoretical results concerned with thermodynamics and kinetics of YIG are described. The main purposes of the review are to introduce a new method ofapproximatecalculation of the magnon spectra in magnets with large unit cell and to obtain by means of this method some basic properties of YIG. In particular, it is shown that the problem of calculating the frequencies of all the 20 magnon branches over the entire Brillouin zone contains two small parameters. First, because of the large number of magnetic atoms in the unit cell the distance between the nearest interacting magnetic atoms is small in comparison with the lattice constant and, accordingly, with the wavelength of a spin wave. An effective long-wavelength character thus arises in the problem. Second, there are a large number of wave-vector directions along which many elements of the Hamiltonian matrix vanish by symmetry in the basis which diagonalizes this matrix for k = 0. These matrix elements thus have an additional, angular smallness for arbitrary directions of k. These matrix elements can be taken into account using perturbation theory. As a result, the large elements of the Hamiltonian matrix are few in number, and they can be eliminated by several two-dimensional rotations. Approximate expressions, differing from the computer calculations by 5 lo\%, are thus obtained for the frequencies. Neutron scattering data are used to find the values of the exchange integrals in YIG and to obtain the magnon spectra. It is shown that in the energy range Ts 260 K only magnons of the lower branch are excited; the spectrum of these “ferromagnons” is quadratic in the wave vector only up to 40 K and becomes linear in the region wli 240 K. For temperatures up to 400 K the temperature dependence of the magnetization is calculated in the spin-wave approximation and good agreement with experimental data is found. A brief review of experimental data on magnon relaxation in YIG is presented. The magnon-magnon interactions which cause the magnon relaxation are described. The amplitude of the four-magnon exchange interaction is determined, and the temperature correction to the frequency is evaluated. This temperature correction is positive, in contrast to the case of simple cubic ferromagnet with nearestneighbour interaction. The exchange relaxation rate is calculated for normal and umklapp processes. It is shown that the magnetic dipole interaction is important only for the ferromagnons; the amplitude of this interaction and the corresponding relaxation rate are determined.},

For this to become a reality advances in ferrite materials must first be realized. These advances include self-bias magnetization, tunability of the magnetic anisotropy, low microwave loss, and volumetric and weight reduction. To achieve these goals one must turn to novel materials processing methods. Here, we review recent advances in the processing of microwave ferrites. Attention is paid to the processing of ferrite films by pulsed laser deposition, liquid phase epitaxy, spin spray ferrite plating, screen printing, and compaction of quasi-single crystals. Conventional and novel applications of ferrite materials, including microwave non-reciprocal passive devices, microwave signal processing, negative index metamaterial-based electronics, and electromagnetic interference suppression are discussed.},

The samples were prepared via auto combustion sol-gel technique, using citric acid as chelating agent and fuel for the combustion process. The obtained powder was heated at 950°C. X-ray diffraction peaks confirmed the garnet phase formation. Crystallite size increases with Al from 28.5894 to 28.6170nm. Lattice constant of the samples was found to decrease from 12.4674Å to 12.3233Å as Al increase from 0.0 to 2.2. FTIR was used to confirm the garnet structure, the main vibrating modes were observed to shift to higher wave number with increasing Al concentration. Saturation magnetization, Ms shows a decreasing trend from 20.721 to 0.7586emu/g with increasing Al from 0.0 to 2.2. Furthermore, the decreasing trends in the static magnetic properties of YAIG samples may be due to the introduction of Al ions in the YIG crystal lattice. High content of Al substitution on YIG leads to paramagnetic behavior of the ferrite. The grain size decreased from 0.64μm to 0.32μm, while the bulk density decreased from 5.058gcm−3 to 4.233gcm−3 as Al increase from 0.0 to 2.2.},

The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of Cr2Ge2Te6 results in significant modification of the spin transport and precession in graphene, which can be ascribed to the proximity-induced exchange interaction. Furthermore, the observation of a larger lifetime for perpendicular spins in comparison to the in-plane counterpart suggests the creation of a proximity-induced anisotropic spin texture in graphene. Our experimental results and density functional theory calculations open up opportunities for the realization of proximity-induced magnetic interactions and spin filters in 2D material heterostructures and can form the basic building blocks for future spintronic and topological quantum devices.},

However, it has been proven to be extremely challenging to achieve a room-temperature ferromagnetic candidate with well controlled dimensionality, large-scale production, and convenient heterogeneous integration. Here, we report the growth of wafer-scale two-dimensional Fe3GeTe2 integrated with a topological insulator of Bi2Te3 by molecular beam epitaxy, which shows a Curie temperature (Tc) up to 400 K with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Dimensionality-dependent magnetic and magnetotransport measurements find that Tc increases with decreasing Fe3GeTe2 thickness in the heterostructures, indicating an interfacial engineering effect from Bi2Te3. The theoretical calculation further proves that the interfacial exchange coupling could significantly enhance the intralayer spin interaction in Fe3GeTe2, hence giving rise to a higher Tc. Our results provide great potential for the implementation of high-performance spintronic devices based on two-dimensional ferromagnetic materials.},

Previous studies in topological insulator thin films suffer from high level of bulk n-type doping making quantitative analysis of weak antilocalization difficult. Here we measure the magneto-resistance of bulk-insulating Bi2Se3 thin films as a function of film thickness and gate-tuned carrier density. For thick samples, the magnitude of weak antilocalization indicates two decoupled (top and bottom) symplectic surfaces. On reducing thickness, we observe first a crossover to a single symplectic channel, indicating coherent coupling of top and bottom surfaces via interlayer tunnelling, and second, a complete suppression of weak antilocalization. The first crossover is governed by the ratio of phase coherence time to the inter-surface tunnelling time, and the second crossover occurs when the hybridization gap becomes comparable to the disorder strength.},

Here, we demonstrate air-stable Na3Bi thin films passivated with magnesium difluoride (MgF2) or silicon (Si) capping layers. Electrical measurements show that deposition of MgF2 or Si has minimal impact on the transport properties of Na3Bi while in ultrahigh vacuum. Importantly, the MgF2-passivated Na3Bi films are air-stable and remain metallic for over 100 h after exposure to air, as compared to near instantaneous degradation when they are unpassivated. Air stability enables transfer of films to a conventional high-magnetic field cryostat, enabling quantum transport measurements, which verify that the Dirac semimetal character of Na3Bi films is retained after air exposure.},

We first illustrate some simple physical ideas to motivate such an approach and then present a systematic derivation of the Chern–Simons–Landau–Ginzburg (CSLG) action for the FQHE, starting from the microscopic Hamiltonian. It is demonstrated that all the phenomenological aspects of the FQHE can be derived from the mean field solution and the small fluctuations of the CSLG action. Although this formalism is logically independent of Laughlin's wave function approach, their physical consequences are equivalent. The CSLG theory demonstrates a deep connection between the phenomena of superfluidity and the FQHE, and can provide a simple and direct formalism to address many new macroscopic phenomena of the FQHE.},

	abstract = {Topological materials have attracted considerable experimental and theoretical attention. They exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling both in the band structure (intrinsic) and in the impurity potentials (extrinsic), although the latter is often neglected. In this work, we discuss weak localization and antilocalization of massless Dirac fermions in topological insulators and massive Dirac fermions in Weyl semimetal thin ﬁlms, taking into account both intrinsic and extrinsic spin-orbit interactions. The physics is governed by the complex interplay of the chiral spin texture, quasiparticle mass, and scalar and spin-orbit scattering. We demonstrate that terms linear in the extrinsic spin-orbit scattering are generally present in the Bloch and momentum relaxation times in all topological materials, and the correction to the diffusion constant is linear in the strength of the extrinsic spin-orbit. In topological insulators, which have zero quasiparticle mass, the terms linear in the impurity spin-orbit coupling lead to an observable density dependence in the weak antilocalization correction. They produce substantial qualitative modiﬁcations to the magnetoconductivity, differing greatly from the conventional Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka formula traditionally used in experimental ﬁts, which predicts a crossover from weak localization to antilocalization as a function of the extrinsic spin-orbit strength. In contrast, our analysis reveals that topological insulators always exhibit weak antilocalization. In Weyl semimetal thin ﬁlms having intermediate to large values of the quasiparticle mass, we show that extrinsic spin-orbit scattering strongly affects the boundary of the weak localization to antilocalization transition. We produce a complete phase diagram for this transition as a function of the mass and spin-orbit scattering strength. Throughout the paper, we discuss implications for experimental work, and, at the end, we provide a brief comparison with transition metal dichalcogenides.},

The Dirac fermions encode topology, flat bands favour correlated phenomena such as magnetism, and van Hove singularities can lead to instabilities towards long-range many-body orders, altogether allowing for the realization and discovery of a series of topological kagome magnets and superconductors with exotic properties. Recent progress in exploring kagome materials has revealed rich emergent phenomena resulting from the quantum interactions between geometry, topology, spin and correlation. Here we review these key developments in this field, starting from the fundamental concepts of a kagome lattice, to the realizations of Chern and Weyl topological magnetism, to various flat-band many-body correlations, and then to the puzzles of unconventional charge-density waves and superconductivity. We highlight the connection between theoretical ideas and experimental observations, and the bond between quantum interactions within kagome magnets and kagome superconductors, as well as their relation to the concepts in topological insulators, topological superconductors, Weyl semimetals and high-temperature superconductors. These developments broadly bridge topological quantum physics and correlated many-body physics in a wide range of bulk materials and substantially advance the frontier of topological quantum matter.},

	abstract = {The hysteresis effect is a common problem in graphene field-effect transistors (FETs). Usually, the external doping to graphene is considered to be responsible for the hysteresis behavior, but is not yet clearly understood. By monitoring the doping of graphene and the hysteresis in graphene FETs under different atmospheres using in situ Raman spectroscopy, it is confirmed that the electrochemical doping of O2/H2O redox couple to graphene is responsible for the hysteresis effect. In addition, Raman spectra of graphene on SiO2 substrate show stronger doping than that suspended, which indicates that SiO2 substrate plays an important role in the doping of graphene. Herein it is proposed that the doping species (H2O and O2) are bounded at the interface of graphene/SiO2 substrate by hydrogen-bonds with the silanol groups on SiO2 substrate. The dynamic equilibrium process of the charge-transfer between H2O/O2 redox couple and graphene under electrical field modulation is carefully analyzed using Marcus–Gerischer theory. This work provides a clear view to the mechanism of the hysteresis effect, and is of benefit to a reliable design to suppress the hysteresis in graphene FETs.},

	abstract = {One of the first theoretically predicted manifestations of strong interactions in many-electron systems was the Wigner crystal1–3, in which electrons crystallize into a regular lattice. The crystal can melt via either thermal or quantum fluctuations4. Quantum melting of the Wigner crystal is predicted to produce exotic intermediate phases5,6 and quantum magnetism7,8 because of the intricate interplay of Coulomb interactions and kinetic energy. However, studying two-dimensional Wigner crystals in the quantum regime has often required a strong magnetic field9–11 or a moiré superlattice potential12–15, thus limiting access to the full phase diagram of the interacting electron liquid. Here we report the observation of bilayer Wigner crystals without magnetic fields or moiré potentials in an atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructure, which consists of two MoSe2 monolayers separated by hexagonal boron nitride. We observe optical signatures of robust correlated insulating states at symmetric (1:1) and asymmetric (3:1, 4:1 and 7:1) electron doping of the two MoSe2 layers at cryogenic temperatures. We attribute these features to bilayer Wigner crystals composed of two interlocked commensurate triangular electron lattices, stabilized by inter-layer interaction16. The Wigner crystal phases are remarkably stable, and undergo quantum and thermal melting transitions at electron densities of up to 6 × 1012 per square centimetre and at temperatures of up to about 40 kelvin. Our results demonstrate that an atomically thin heterostructure is a highly tunable platform for realizing many-body electronic states and probing their liquid–solid and magnetic quantum phase transitions4–8,17.},

Efforts to observe2–12 this elusive state of matter, termed a Wigner crystal, in two-dimensional extended systems have primarily focused on conductivity measurements on electrons confined to a single Landau level at high magnetic fields. Here we use optical spectroscopy to demonstrate that electrons in a monolayer semiconductor with density lower than 3 × 1011 per centimetre squared form a Wigner crystal. The combination of a high electron effective mass and reduced dielectric screening enables us to observe electronic charge order even in the absence of a moiré potential or an external magnetic field. The interactions between a resonantly injected exciton and electrons arranged in a periodic lattice modify the exciton bandstructure so that an umklapp resonance arises in the optical reflection spectrum, heralding the presence of charge order13. Our findings demonstrate that charge-tunable transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers14 enable the investigation of previously uncharted territory for many-body physics where interaction energy dominates over kinetic energy.},

	abstract = {The Wigner crystal1 has fascinated condensed matter physicists for nearly 90 years2–14. Signatures of two-dimensional (2D) Wigner crystals were first observed in 2D electron gases under high magnetic field2–4, and recently reported in transition metal dichalcogenide moiré superlattices6–9. Direct observation of the 2D Wigner crystal lattice in real space, however, has remained an outstanding challenge. Conventional scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) has sufficient spatial resolution but induces perturbations that can potentially alter this fragile state. Here we demonstrate real-space imaging of 2D Wigner crystals in WSe2/WS2 moiré heterostructures using a specially designed non-invasive STM spectroscopy technique. This employs a graphene sensing layer held close to the WSe2/WS2 moiré superlattice. Local STM tunnel current into the graphene layer is modulated by the underlying Wigner crystal electron lattice in the WSe2/WS2 heterostructure. Different Wigner crystal lattice configurations at fractional electron fillings of n = 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3, where n is the electron number per site, are directly visualized. The n = 1/3 and n = 2/3 Wigner crystals exhibit triangular and honeycomb lattices, respectively, to minimize nearest-neighbour occupations. The n = 1/2 state spontaneously breaks the original C3 symmetry and forms a stripe phase. Our study lays a solid foundation for understanding Wigner crystal states in WSe2/WS2 moiré heterostructures and provides an approach that is generally applicable for imaging novel correlated electron lattices in other systems.},

To solve the problem, here we develop a robotic system that searches exfoliated two-dimensional crystals and assembles them into superlattices inside the glovebox. The system can autonomously detect 400 monolayer graphene flakes per hour with a small error rate ({\textless}7\%) and stack four cycles of the designated two-dimensional crystals per hour with few minutes of human intervention for each stack cycle. The system enabled fabrication of the superlattice consisting of 29 alternating layers of the graphene and the hexagonal boron nitride. This capacity provides a scalable approach for prototyping a variety of van der Waals superlattices.},

However, integrating the material into large-scale two-dimensional heterostructures remains challenging due to the difficulties in synthesizing high-quality large-area multilayer hBN and combining it with other two-dimensional material layers of the same scale. Here we show that centimetre-scale multilayer hBN can be synthesized on iron–nickel alloy foil by chemical vapour deposition, and then used as a substrate and as a surface-protecting layer in graphene field-effect transistors. We also develop an integrated electrochemical transfer and thermal treatment method that allows us to create high-performance graphene/hBN heterostacks. Arrays of graphene field-effect transistors fabricated by conventional and scalable methods show an enhancement in room-temperature carrier mobility when hBN is used as an insulating substrate, and a further increase—up to a value of 10,000 cm2 V−1 s−1—when graphene is encapsulated with another hBN sheet.},

It accordingly becomes necessary to test whether this is actually the case. The experiments we have made have confirmed this anticipation, and shown that in every case in which light is scattered by the molecules in dust-free liquids or gases, the diffuse radiation of the ordinary kind, having the same wave-length as the incident beam, is accompanied by a modified scattered radiation of degraded frequency.},

	abstract = {Weakly Interacting Graphene
Many unusual properties of graphene are a consequence of the Dirac dispersion of its electrons—a linear relationship between an electron's momentum and energy. Naïvely, this dispersion leads to the conclusion that electrons in graphene are strongly affected by mutual electrostatic interactions; however, there is little experimental evidence for strong interaction. Reed et al. (p. 805) resolved this discrepancy by using inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of graphite (which consists of loosely bound layers of graphene) to estimate how much the electric field was damped by the presence of mobile charge carriers. In fact, damping was strong at distances in excess of 1 nanometer, suggesting that graphene is more weakly interacting than was assumed.
Electrons in graphene behave like Dirac fermions, permitting phenomena from high-energy physics to be studied in a solid-state setting. A key question is whether or not these fermions are critically influenced by Coulomb correlations. We performed inelastic x-ray scattering experiments on crystals of graphite and applied reconstruction algorithms to image the dynamical screening of charge in a freestanding graphene sheet. We found that the polarizability of the Dirac fermions is amplified by excitonic effects, improving screening of interactions between quasiparticles. The strength of interactions is characterized by a scale-dependent, effective fine-structure constant, {\textless}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/330/6005/805/embed/mml-math-1.gif"/{\textgreater}, the value of which approaches {\textless}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/330/6005/805/embed/mml-math-2.gif"/{\textgreater} at low energy and large distances.

Yet, the development of graphene field-effect devices based on the 3C-SiC/Si substrate system has been historically hindered by poor graphene quality and coverage, as well as substantial leakage issues of the heteroepitaxial system. We address these issues by growing EG on 3C-SiC on highly resistive silicon substrates using an alloy-mediated approach. In this work, we demonstrate a field-effect transistor based on EG/3C-SiC/Si with gate leakage current 6 orders of magnitude lower than the drain current at room temperature, which is a vast improvement on the current literature, opening the possibility for dynamically tunable nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices on silicon at the wafer level.},

A comparison of temperature-dependent electrical measurements of millimeter-scale passivated and bare graphene on SiO2/Si indicates that the passivated graphene maintains its high field effect mobility desirable for applications. Surprisingly, the temperature-dependent resistivity is reduced in passivated graphene over a range of temperatures below 220 K, due to the interplay of screening of the surface optical phonon modes of the SiO2 by high-dielectric-constant Ga2O3 and the relatively high characteristic phonon frequencies of Ga2O3. Raman spectroscopy and electrical measurements indicate that Ga2O3 passivation also protects graphene from further processing such as plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of Al2O3.},

It has also led to the establishment of a new metrological standard, the resistance quantum. Disappointingly, however, the QHE has been observed only at liquid-helium temperatures. We show that in graphene, in a single atomic layer of carbon, the QHE can be measured reliably even at room temperature, which makes possible QHE resistance standards becoming available to a broader community, outside a few national institutions.},

Structural measurements indicated that the out-of-plane lattice spacing of TbIG layers firstly increased with the rising thickness of GGG (tG) and then decreased, which was attributed to the impact of the buffer layer on strain relaxation of the epitaxial films. A variation of compensation temperature was found at tG about 30 nm. Furthermore, both the anomalous Hall resistance and its sign change temperature increased and then kept constant with increasing tG. Our results indicated that strain played a key role to tune the physical properties of Pt/TbIG/GGG heterostructures, providing a possible approach to tune the spin-orbital coupling in heavy metal/ferromagnetic insulator system by strain engineering.},

	abstract = {The “magnetoelectric effect” arises from the coupling between magnetic and electric properties in materials. The Z2 invariant of topological insulators (TIs) leads to a quantized version of this phenomenon, known as the topological magnetoelectric (TME) effect. This effect can be realized in a new topological phase called an “axion insulator” whose surface states are all gapped but the interior still obeys time reversal symmetry. We demonstrate such a phase using electrical transport measurements in a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) sandwich heterostructure, in which two compositionally different magnetic TI layers are separated by an undoped TI layer. Magnetic force microscopy images of the same sample reveal sequential magnetization reversals of the top and bottom layers at different coercive fields, a consequence of the weak interlayer exchange coupling due to the spacer. When the magnetization is antiparallel, both the Hall resistance and Hall conductance show zero plateaus, accompanied by a large longitudinal resistance and vanishing longitudinal conductance, indicating the realization of an axion insulator state. Our findings thus show evidence for a phase of matter distinct from the established QAH state and provide a promising platform for the realization of the TME effect.},

We assemble bilayers with pristine interfaces using exfoliated flakes of the TI BiSbTeSe2 and the magnet Cr2Ge2Te6, thereby avoiding problems caused by interdiffusion that can affect interfaces made by top-down deposition methods. The samples exhibit an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with abrupt hysteretic switching. For the first time in samples composed of a TI and a separate ferromagnetic layer, we demonstrate that the amplitude of the AHE can be tuned via gate voltage with a strong peak near the Dirac point.

For the six septuple-layer device tuned into the insulating regime, we observe a large longitudinal resistance and zero Hall plateau, which are characteristics of an axion insulator state. The robust axion insulator state occurs in zero magnetic field, over a wide magnetic-field range and at relatively high temperatures. Moreover, a moderate magnetic field drives a quantum phase transition from the axion insulator phase to a Chern insulator phase with zero longitudinal resistance and quantized Hall resistance h/e2, where h is Planck’s constant and e is electron charge. Our results pave the way for using even-number septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 to realize the quantized topological magnetoelectric effect and axion electrodynamics in condensed matter systems.},

A promising scheme is using the magnetic proximity effect (MPE), where a ferromagnetic insulator magnetizes the topological insulator. Most of these heterostructures are synthesized by growth techniques which prevent mixing many of the available ferromagnetic and topological insulators due to difference in growth conditions. Here, we demonstrate that MPE can be obtained in heterostructures stacked via the dry transfer of flakes of van der Waals ferromagnetic and topological insulators (Cr2Ge2Te6/BiSbTeSe2), as evidenced in the observation of an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Furthermore, devices made from these heterostructures allow modulation of the AHE when controlling the carrier density via electrostatic gating. These results show that simple mechanical transfer of magnetic van der Waals materials provides another possible avenue to magnetize topological insulators by MPE.},

In the as-grown single crystals, clear evidences of ferromagnetic ordering were observed. The angle-resolve photoemission spectroscopy indicates the ferromagnetism opens a ∼44 meV band gap at the surface Dirac point. Moreover, the mobility of the carriers at 3 K is ∼7400cm2/Vs, and we thus observed an ultra-strong Shubnikov–de Haas oscillation in the longitudinal resistivity, as well as the Hall steps in transverse resistivity {\textless}14 T. Our transport and angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy results suggest that the RE and transition metal codoping in the Bi2Se3 system is a promising avenue to implement the QAHE, as well as harnessing the massive Dirac fermion in electrical devices.},

Several approaches have been proposed to construct electronic devices with low-energy consumption. Among these, the low-dissipation surface states of topological insulators (TIs) are widely employed. To develop TI-based devices, a key factor is the maximum temperature at which the Dirac surface states dominate the transport behavior. Here, we employ Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations (SdH) as a means to study the surface state survival temperature in a high-quality vanadium doped Bi1.08Sn0.02Sb0.9Te2S single crystal system. The temperature and angle dependence of the SdH show that: (1) crystals with different vanadium (V) doping levels are insulating in the 3–300 K region; (2) the SdH oscillations show two-dimensional behavior, indicating that the oscillations arise from the pure surface states; and (3) at 50 K, the V0.04 single crystals (Vx:Bi1.08-xSn0.02Sb0.9Te2S, where x = 0.04) still show clear sign of SdH oscillations, which demonstrate that the surface dominant transport behavior can survive above 50 K. The robust surface states in our V doped single crystal systems provide an ideal platform to study the Dirac fermions and their interaction with other materials above 50 K.},

	abstract = {The p-type surface conductivity of hydrogen-terminated diamond (H-diamond) provides a viable approach toward diamond-based wide-bandgap metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) for high-power and high-frequency electronics. A facile, low-cost, and low-temperature method to form gate dielectrics on diamond that also preserves the integrity of hydrogen-termination is highly desirable for high-performance diamond surface electronics with process flexibility and high yield. In this work, we demonstrate a p-channel diamond MOSFET with an ultrathin glassy Ga2O3 dielectric layer derived from liquid metal. A liquid metal printing method was employed to transfer an amorphous Ga2O3 layer over the desired active p-channel region of H-diamond at low temperature, allowing the protection and preservation the hydrogen-terminated surface while also forming an efficient gate dielectric. The results of this work suggest that the liquid metal method can provide an efficient, low-cost, and high-yield pathway to form high-quality dielectrics for diamond-based transistors.},

However, their metal catalyst-based growth and transfer-based heterostructure assembly approaches present impediments to obtaining high-quality and wafer-scale quantum material. Here, we have presented our perspective on the synthetic strategies that involve direct nucleation of h-BN on various dielectric substrates and its heterostructures with graphene. Mechanistic understanding of direct growth of h-BN via bottom-up approaches such as (a) the chemical-interaction guided nucleation on silicon-based dielectrics, (b) surface nitridation and N$^{\textrm{+}}$ sputtering of h-BN target on sapphire, and (c) epitaxial growth of h-BN on sapphire, among others, are reviewed. Several design methodologies are presented for the direct growth of vertical and lateral vdW heterostructures of h-BN and graphene. These complex 2D heterostructures exhibit various physical phenomena and could potentially have a range of practical applications.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, an experimental observation is reported of the quantum anomalous Hall effect in a magnetically-doped topological insulator grown on the antiferromagnetic insulator Cr2O3. The exchange coupling between the two materials is investigated using field-cooling-dependent magnetometry and polarized neutron reflectometry. Both techniques reveal strong interfacial interaction between the antiferromagnetic order of the Cr2O3 and the magnetic topological insulator, manifested as an exchange bias when the sample is field-cooled under an out-of-plane magnetic field, and an exchange spring-like magnetic depth profile when the system is magnetized within the film plane. These results identify antiferromagnetic insulators as suitable candidates for the manipulation of magnetic and topological order in topological insulator films.},

	abstract = {A Bose–Einstein condensate is the ground state of a dilute gas of bosons, such as atoms cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero1. With much smaller mass, excitons (bound electron–hole pairs) are expected to condense at considerably higher temperatures2–7. Two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductors with very strong exciton binding are ideal systems for the study of high-temperature exciton condensation. Here we study electrically generated interlayer excitons in MoSe2–WSe2 atomic double layers with a density of up to 1012 excitons per square centimetre. The interlayer tunnelling current depends only on the exciton density, which is indicative of correlated electron–hole pair tunnelling8. Strong electroluminescence arises when a hole tunnels from WSe2 to recombine with an electron in MoSe2. We observe a critical threshold dependence of the electroluminescence intensity on exciton density, accompanied by super-Poissonian photon statistics near the threshold, and a large electroluminescence enhancement with a narrow peak at equal electron and hole densities. The phenomenon persists above 100 kelvin, which is consistent with the predicted critical condensation temperature9–12. Our study provides evidence for interlayer exciton condensation in two-dimensional atomic double layers and opens up opportunities for exploring condensate-based optoelectronics and exciton-mediated high-temperature superconductivity13.},

	abstract = {Electrical control of magnetism in van der Waals ferromagnetic semiconductors is an important step in creating novel spintronic devices, capable of processing and storing information, with these materials. For practical devices, electrical control at or near room temperature is sought, but most layered ferromagnetic semiconductors exhibit Curie temperatures below 100 K. Here, we show that electrostatic gating of thin chromium germanium telluride (Cr2Ge2Te6) crystals can be used to modulate the magnetic phase transition and magnetic anisotropy of this layered ferromagnetic semiconductor and increase its Curie temperature. Using an electric double-layer transistor device, we observe ferromagnetism in the material at temperatures up to 200 K and find that its magnetic easy axis is in the in-plane direction, in contrast to the out-of-plane easy axis of undoped Cr2Ge2Te6. Our analysis suggests that heavy doping promotes a double-exchange mechanism that is mediated by free carriers, which dominates over the superexchange mechanism of the original insulating state.},

The films have sheet resistances as low as ∼125 Ω □−1 with 97.4\% optical transmittance, and exhibit the half-integer quantum Hall effect, indicating their high quality. We further use layer-by-layer stacking to fabricate a doped four-layer film and measure its sheet resistance at values as low as ∼30 Ω □−1 at ∼90\% transparency, which is superior to commercial transparent electrodes such as indium tin oxides. Graphene electrodes were incorporated into a fully functional touch-screen panel device capable of withstanding high strain.},

While much effort has been devoted to studying (quantum) anomalous Hall effects in magnetic magnetically doped TIs, the inherent magnetoresistance (MR) properties in magnetic proximity-coupled surface states remain largely unexplored. Here, we directly exfoliate Bi2Se3 TI flakes onto a magnetic insulator, yttrium iron garnet, and measure the MR at various temperatures. We experimentally observe an anisotropic magnetoresistance that is consistent with a magnetized surface state. Our results indicate that the TI has magnetic anisotropy out of the sample plane, which opens an energy gap between the surface states. By applying a magnetic field along any in-plane orientation, the magnetization of the TI rotates toward the plane and the gap closes. Consequently, we observe a large (∼6.5\%) MR signal that is attributed to an interplay between coherent rotation of magnetization within a topological insulator and abrupt switching of magnetization in the underlying magnetic insulator.},

	abstract = {Introducing magnetic order in a topological insulator (TI) breaks time-reversal symmetry of the surface states and can thus yield a variety of interesting physics and promises for novel spintronic devices. To date, however, magnetic effects in TIs have been demonstrated only at temperatures far below those needed for practical applications. In this work, we study the magnetic properties of Bi2Se3 surface states (SS) in the proximity of a high Tc ferrimagnetic insulator (FMI), yttrium iron garnet (YIG or Y3Fe5O12). Proximity-induced butterfly and square-shaped magnetoresistance loops are observed by magneto-transport measurements with out-of-plane and in-plane fields, respectively, and can be correlated with the magnetization of the YIG substrate. More importantly, a magnetic signal from the Bi2Se3 up to 130 K is clearly observed by magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements. Our results demonstrate the proximity-induced TI magnetism at higher temperatures, an important step toward room-temperature application of TI-based spintronic devices.},

Graphene-dielectric integration is of critical importance for the development of graphene transistors and a new generation of graphene based electronics. Deposition of dielectric materials onto graphene is of significant challenge due to the intrinsic material incompatibility between pristine graphene and dielectric oxide materials. Here we review various strategies being researched for graphene-dielectric integration. Physical vapor deposition (PVD) can be used to directly deposit dielectric materials on graphene, but often introduces significant defects into the monolayer of carbon lattice; Atomic layer deposition (ALD) process has also been explored to to deposit high-κ dielectrics on graphene, which however requires functionalization of graphene surface with reactive groups, inevitably leading to a significant degradation in carrier mobilities; Using naturally oxidized thin aluminum or polymer as buffer layer for dielectric deposition can mitigate the damages to graphene lattice and improve the carrier mobility of the resulted top-gated transistors; Lastly, a physical assembly approach has recently been explored to integrate dielectric nanostructures with graphene without introducing any appreciable defects, and enabled top-gated graphene transistors with the highest carrier mobility reported to date. We will conclude with a brief summary and perspective on future opportunities.},

The corresponding sound velocities (nTA ¼ 12:9 km=s,nLA ¼ 19:9 km=s) of graphene have been accessed, which are about 10\% smaller than those of graphite. Based on nTA and nLA, the two-dimensional (2d) elastic stiffness (tension) coefficients c11 and c66, Young0s modulus Y2d and Poisson0s ratio s2d can be estimated. The results demonstrate again that double resonant Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool to probe the fundamental properties of graphene.},

We use density-functional theory and density-functional perturbation theory together with very accurate Wannier interpolations to compute all electronic and vibrational properties and electron–phonon coupling matrix elements; the phonon-limited resistivity is then calculated within a Boltzmann-transport approach. An effective tight-binding model, validated against first-principles results, is also used to study the role of electron–electron interactions at the level of many-body perturbation theory. The results found are in excellent agreement with recent experimental data on graphene samples at high carrier densities and elucidate the role of the different phonon modes in limiting electron mobility. Moreover, we find that the resistivity arising from scattering with transverse acoustic phonons is 2.5 times higher than that from longitudinal acoustic phonons. Last, high-energy, optical, and zone-boundary phonons contribute as much as acoustic phonons to the intrinsic electrical resistivity even at room temperature and become dominant at higher temperatures.},

This requires reasonably large fields (at the level of 1 V/nm necessary to induce relevant electron density changes) applied over a gating dielectric material. At these fields, most dielectrics show some conduction, which leads to an important question: what is the best dielectric to gate graphene? Here, we show that this question is imprecise as a dielectric material produced by different fabrication methods can exhibit dramatically different gating properties. Namely, we show that two oxide dielectrics (hafnia and alumina) result in positive hysteresis of graphene gating characteristics being fabricated by atomic layer deposition and negative hysteresis being fabricated by electron beam evaporation. We attribute this behavior to the stoichiometry of the samples and oxygen ion migration. It implies that oxide dielectrics should be avoided in graphene gated devices working at room temperatures.},

The recent development of simple experimental techniques for combining graphene with other atomically thin vdW crystals to form heterostructures has enabled the exploration of the properties of these so-called vdW heterostructures. Hexagonal boron nitride is the second most popular vdW material after graphene, owing to the new physics and device properties of vdW heterostructures combining the two. Hexagonal boron nitride can act as a featureless dielectric substrate for graphene, enabling devices with ultralow disorder that allow access to the intrinsic physics of graphene, such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects. Additionally, under certain circumstances, hexagonal boron nitride can modify the optical and electronic properties of graphene in new ways, inducing the appearance of secondary Dirac points or driving new plasmonic states. Integrating other vdW materials into these heterostructures and tuning their new degrees of freedom, such as the relative rotation between crystals and their interlayer spacing, provide a path for engineering and manipulating nearly limitless new physics and device properties.},

Micro-Raman spectroscopy and temperature dependent Hall mobility measurements reveal that the processing induced changes to the structural and electrical properties of the MLG can be minimal when the oxide deposition conditions are optimal. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis confirms that the Al2O3/MLG interface is relatively sharp and that our thickness approximation of the MLG using angle resolved x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) is accurate. An interface trap density of 5.1 × 1010 eV − 1 cm − 2 was determined using capacitance–voltage techniques. The totality of our results indicates that ARXPS can be used as a nondestructive tool to measure the thickness of MLG, and that RF sputtered Al2O3 can be used as a high dielectric (high-k) constant gate oxide in multilayer graphene based transistor applications.},

	abstract = {Innovative breakthroughs in fundamental research and industrial applications of graphene material have made its mass and low-cost production as a necessary step toward its real world applications. This one-atom thick crystal of carbon, gathers a set of unique physico-chemical properties, ranging from its extreme mechanical behavior to its exceptional electrical and thermal conductivities, which are making graphene as a serious alternative to replace many conventional materials for various applications. In this review paper, we highlight the most important experimental results on the synthesis of graphene material, its emerging properties with reference to its smart applications. We discuss the possibility to successfully integrating graphene directly into device, enabling thereby the realization of a wide range of applications, including actuation, photovoltaic, thermoelectricity, shape memory, self-healing, electrorheology, and space missions. The future outlook of graphene is also considered and discussed.},

	abstract = {Designing thermoelectric materials with high figure of merit ZT = S2GT/Ktot requires fulfilling three often irreconcilable conditions, that is, the high electrical conductance G, small thermal conductance Ktot, and high Seebeck coefficient S. Nanostructuring is one of the promising ways to achieve this goal as it can substantially suppress lattice contribution to Ktot. However, it may also unfavorably influence the electronic transport in an uncontrollable way. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that this issue can be ideally solved by fabricating graphene nanoribbons with heavy adatoms and nanopores. The adatoms locally enhance spin–orbit coupling in graphene thereby converting it into a two-dimensional topological insulator with a band gap in the bulk and robust helical edge states, which carry electrical current and generate a highly optimized power factor S2G per helical conducting channel due to narrow boxcar-function-shaped electronic transmission (surpassing even the Mahan-Sofo limit obtained for delta-function-shaped electronic transmission). Concurrently, the array of nanopores impedes the lattice thermal conduction through the bulk. Using quantum transport simulations coupled with first-principles electronic and phononic band structure calculations, the thermoelectric figure of merit is found to reach its maximum ZT ≃ 3 at low temperatures T ≃ 40 K. This paves a way to design high-ZT materials by exploiting the nontrivial topology of electronic states through nanostructuring.},

The value of the saturated velocity shows very weak dependence on the carrier density, the nature of the insulating substrate, and the low-field mobility, varied by the charged impurity concentration. The saturated velocity of 4×107–8×107 cm/s calculated at room temperature is significantly larger than reported experimental values. The discrepancy is due to the self-heating effect which lowers substantially the value of the saturated velocity. We predict that by reducing the insulator oxide thickness, which limits the thermal conductance, the saturated currents can be significantly enhanced. We also calculate the surface polar phonon contribution to the low-field mobility as a function of carrier density, temperature, and distance from the substrate.},

The results indicate one infrared active lattice mode for in-plane motion of the particles and one for out-of-plane motion, in accordance with the boron-nitride structure reported by Pease and the resulting group-theoretical selection rules. In addition, one Raman line has been found corresponding to a lattice mode for in-plane motion.

A charged particle on approaching or leaving the surface may suffer inelastic scattering owing to its coupling with these modes. The scattering rate is calculated in the Born approximation for two instances: (i) in metals, where the surface modes are plasma oscillations and (ii) in dielectrics, with optical surface phonons. For electrons in a parabolic band with energy of the order of a few electron volts, it is found that on traversing the sample, the probability of scattering is of order 1. Furthermore, this probability is highly anisotropic. These findings strongly suggest that this scattering effect should be incorporated in the analysis of energy or spatial distribution of charged-particle probes, at least in the low-energy regime.},

Through the enhanced chemical reactivity at defect sites (point defects, line defects, etc.), one can selectively functionalize 2D materials via chemical reactions and thereby tune their physical properties. We demonstrate the selective atomic layer deposition of LiF on defect sites of h-BN prepared by chemical vapor deposition. The LiF deposits primarily on the line and point defects of h-BN, thereby creating seams that hold the h-BN crystallites together. The chemically and mechanically stable hybrid LiF/h-BN film successfully suppresses lithium dendrite formation during both the initial electrochemical deposition onto a copper foil and the subsequent cycling. The protected lithium electrodes exhibit good cycling behavior with more than 300 cycles at relatively high coulombic efficiency ({\textgreater}95\%) in an additive-free carbonate electrolyte.

First, protective sealing of h-BN is shown by preserving germanium from oxidation in air at high temperatures. Second, the membrane functionality of the single h-BN layer is demonstrated in aqueous solutions.

	abstract = {The development of two-dimensional (2D) materials has opened up possibilities for their application in electronics, optoelectronics and photovoltaics, because they can provide devices with smaller size, higher speed and additional functionalities compared with conventional silicon-based devices1. The ability to grow large, high-quality single crystals for 2D components—that is, conductors, semiconductors and insulators—is essential for the industrial application of 2D devices2–4. Atom-layered hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with its excellent stability, flat surface and large bandgap, has been reported to be the best 2D insulator5–12. However, the size of 2D hBN single crystals is typically limited to less than one millimetre13–18, mainly because of difficulties in the growth of such crystals; these include excessive nucleation, which precludes growth from a single nucleus to large single crystals, and the threefold symmetry of the hBN lattice, which leads to antiparallel domains and twin boundaries on most substrates19. Here we report the epitaxial growth of a 100-square-centimetre single-crystal hBN monolayer on a low-symmetry Cu (110) vicinal surface, obtained by annealing an industrial copper foil. Structural characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that epitaxial growth was achieved by the coupling of Cu {\textless}211{\textgreater} step edges with hBN zigzag edges, which breaks the equivalence of antiparallel hBN domains, enabling unidirectional domain alignment better than 99 per cent. The growth kinetics, unidirectional alignment and seamless stitching of the hBN domains are unambiguously demonstrated using centimetre- to atomic-scale characterization techniques. Our findings are expected to facilitate the wide application of 2D devices and lead to the epitaxial growth of broad non-centrosymmetric 2D materials, such as various transition-metal dichalcogenides20–23, to produce large single crystals.},

The h-BN films obtained via chemical vapour deposition in earlier reports are always polycrystalline with small grains because of high nucleation density on substrates. Here we report the successful synthesis of large single-crystal h-BN grains on rational designed Cu–Ni alloy foils. It is found that the nucleation density can be greatly reduced to 60 per mm2 by optimizing Ni ratio in substrates. The strategy enables the growth of single-crystal h-BN grains up to 7,500 μm2, approximately two orders larger than that in previous reports. This work not only provides valuable information for understanding h-BN nucleation and growth mechanisms, but also gives an effective alternative to exfoliated h-BN as a high-quality dielectric layer for large-scale nanoelectronic applications.},

However, the controllable synthesis of multilayer h-BN in large areas is still limited in terms of crystallinity, thickness and stacking order. Here, we report a vapor–liquid–solid growth (VLSG) method to achieve uniform multilayer h-BN by using a molten Fe82B18 alloy and N2 as reactants. Liquid Fe82B18 not only supplies boron but also continuously dissociates nitrogen atoms from the N2 vapor to support direct h-BN growth on a sapphire substrate; therefore, the VLSG method delivers high-quality h-BN multilayers with a controllable thickness. Further investigation of the phase evolution of the Fe-B-N system reveals that isothermal segregation dominates the growth of the h-BN. The approach herein demonstrates the feasibility for large-area fabrication of van der Waals 2D materials and heterostructures.},

Here, we introduce an efficient PDMS printing strategy to simultaneously realize the controllable preparation and subsequent transfer of a large-area non-layered 2D Ga2O3 amorphous layer on the basis of ultrathin oxide skin of liquid Ga. More importantly, a template-confined reaction of the 2D Ga2O3 amorphous layer is further proposed to achieve other 2D Ga-group crystals including 2D GaN, GaS, and GaP thin layers. The corresponding crystallization and transformation process under the 2D geometrical space is investigated and demonstrated to be polycrystalline nucleation and growth, which still follows the traditional thermodynamic nucleation rule of critical radius. Furthermore, 2D Ga-group semiconductors could easily stack with themselves or other layered 2D crystals such as MoS2 to construct diverse van der Waals heterostructures for the fabrication of high-performance and multifunctional electronics. We believe that the unique and simple synthetic strategy proposed in this work will promote the preparation and transfer of diverse non-layered 2D crystals for the discovery of new phenomena and functional nanodevices.},

Integration of TMDCs into practical all-dielectric heterostructures hinges on the ability to passivate and protect them against necessary fabrication steps on large scales. Despite its limited scalability, encapsulation of TMDCs in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) currently has no viable alternative for achieving high performance of the final device. Here, it is shown that the novel, ultrathin Ga2O3 glass is an ideal centimeter-scale coating material that enhances optical performance of the monolayers and protects them against further material deposition. In particular, Ga2O3 capping of monolayer WS2 outperforms commercial-grade hBN in both scalability and optical performance at room temperature. These properties make Ga2O3 highly suitable for large-scale passivation and protection of monolayer TMDCs in functional heterostructures.},

	abstract = {Single- or multi-layer transition metal oxides (TMOs) have a relatively longer history than other atomically thin materials. TMOs comprise many earth-abundant minerals and have been used for millenia as construction materials, pigments, lubricants, for heat management and many other applications. In TMOs, the transition metal s electrons are strongly pulled by oxygen, and consequently the structural, physical and chemical properties are mostly determined by the strongly correlated d electrons. TMOs are also highly tunable owing to the diversity of their chemical composition, crystal structure and relative ease in inducing oxygen defects. Two dimensional (2D) TMOs often show different physical and chemical properties in comparison to their bulk counterparts. These differences give rise to a variety of remarkable electronic properties such as high temperature superconductivity and multiferroicity and also unique optical, mechanical and thermal phenomena. Additionally, reducing the thickness of TMOs can alter their catalytic and chemical characteristics. Despite their unique properties, single- and few-layer TMOs have received relatively little attention compared to other recent families of atomically thin materials such as layered transition metal dichalcogenides. The overarching aim of this review is to bring the unique aspects of TMOs to the attention of the research community to establish a strong future for research on 2D and layered TMOs. In this review, a comprehensive overview regarding 2D and layered TMOs will be presented. The fundamentals and applications of planar TMOs are discussed. The manuscript will also present future prospects and pathways to new developments that are offered by such TMOs.},

Using the analytic forms of the coupling matrix elements, we study the acoustic phonon-limited carrier mobility and quasiparticle lifetime observable in photoemission spectroscopy for temperatures 0–200 K and high carrier densities of 1012–1013 cm−2. We find that the intrinsic effective acoustic deformation potential of graphene is Ξeff=6.8 eV and that the temperature dependence of the mobility μ∼T−α in the Bloch-Grüneisen regime increases beyond an α=4 dependence even in the absence of screening when the true coupling matrix elements are considered. The α{\textgreater}4 temperature dependence of the mobility is found to originate in a similar temperature dependence of the relaxation time at the Fermi level. The large disagreement between our calculated deformation potential and those extracted from experimental measurements (18–29 eV) indicates that additional or modified acoustic phonon-scattering mechanisms are at play in experimental situations.},

At low temperatures, the TEP in GIC's increases monotonically with T, then levels off above ∼200 K in striking contrast to that of pristine graphite. The diffusion contribution to the TEP is proportional to T and its magnitude is small as compared with that of the observed data. This observed behavior is attributed to the phonon drag effect. In the temperature region where the TEP is weakly temperature dependent, phonon relaxation is mainly controlled by the Rayleigh scattering due to point defects. The resultant TEP, which is composed of the phonon drag and diffusion terms, leads to a nearly T-independent value. Since the cross-sectional diameter of the Fermi surface in GIC's is larger than that of pristine graphite, the relaxation rate of the Rayleigh scattering, which is given by 1tI(q)=fq3, becomes very large at high temperatures (T{\textgreater}100 K). At low temperatures, where the boundary scattering plays a dominant role, the TEP is proportional to T3. Detailed calculations are carried out by solving the phonon-carrier-coupled Boltzmann equation.},

	abstract = {A novel method to form ultrathin, uniform Al2O3 layers on graphene using reversible hydrogen plasma functionalization followed by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is presented. ALD on pristine graphene is known to be a challenge due to the absence of dangling bonds, leading to nonuniform ﬁlm coverage. We show that hydrogen plasma functionalization of graphene leads to uniform ALD of closed Al2O3 ﬁlms down to 8 nm in thickness. Hall measurements and Raman spectroscopy reveal that the hydrogen plasma functionalization is reversible upon Al2O3 ALD and subsequent annealing at 400 °C and in this way does not deteriorate the graphene’s charge carrier mobility. This is in contrast with oxygen plasma functionalization, which can lead to a uniform 5 nm thick closed ﬁlm, but which is not reversible and leads to a reduction of the charge carrier mobility. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations attribute the uniform growth on both H2 and O2 plasma functionalized graphene to the enhanced adsorption of trimethylaluminum (TMA) on these surfaces. A DFT analysis of the possible reaction pathways for TMA precursor adsorption on hydrogenated graphene predicts a binding mechanism that cleans oﬀ the hydrogen functionalities from the surface, which explains the observed reversibility of the hydrogen plasma functionalization upon Al2O3 ALD.},

	abstract = {Based on micro-Raman spectroscopy (μRS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we study the structural damage incurred in monolayer (1L) and few-layer (FL) graphene subjected to atomic-layer deposition of HfO2 and Al2O3 upon different oxygen plasma power levels. We evaluate the damage level and the influence of the HfO2 thickness on graphene. The results indicate that in the case of Al2O3/graphene, whether 1L or FL graphene is strongly damaged under our process conditions. For the case of HfO2/graphene, μRS analysis clearly shows that FL graphene is less disordered than 1L graphene. In addition, the damage levels in FL graphene decrease with the number of layers. Moreover, the FL graphene damage is inversely proportional to the thickness of HfO2 film. Particularly, the bottom layer of twisted bilayer (t-2L) has the salient features of 1L graphene. Therefore, FL graphene allows for controlling/limiting the degree of defect during the PE-ALD HfO2 of dielectrics and could be a good starting material for building field effect transistors, sensors, touch screens and solar cells. Besides, the formation of Hf-C bonds may favor growing high-quality and uniform-coverage dielectric. HfO2 could be a suitable high-K gate dielectric with a scaling capability down to sub-5-nm for graphene-based transistors.},

The refractive indices were greater than 1.92 and increased linearly with increasing x. The polarizabilities of oxide ions were estimated to be 2.16–2.41 Å3, indicating that the glasses were highly ionic. The glasses were transparent over a very wide range from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared region. The widest transparent window among the oxide glasses was from 270 nm to 10 μm at x = 55. From the Raman scattering spectra, a decrease in bridging oxide ions and an increase in non-bridging oxide ions were confirmed to occur with increasing La2O3 content. The maximum phonon energy was found to be approximately 650 cm−1, being one of the lowest among oxide glasses. These results show that La2O3-Ga2O3 binary glasses should be promising host materials for optical applications such as lenses, windows, and filters over a very wide wavelength range.},

In this way, conformal films are deposited at high deposition rates, achieving high broadband transparency, wide band gap (3.5–4 eV), and low refractive index (1.6 at 500 nm). The authors link this low refractive index to the presence of nanoscale voids enclosing H2, as indicated by electron energy-loss spectroscopy.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) method was used to study the crystalline structure of the films. The oxide films grown on silicon substrate have amorphous structure while those oxide films grown on glass substrate show crystalline Ga2O3 structure, which confirms that the titanium was dissolved in the lattice of Ga2O3 forming solid solution (SS). The insulating properties of the amorphous Ti-included Ga-oxide films were studied for samples made in form of MOS:Au/Ga2O3:Ti/Si configuration. It was observed that Ti inclusion of certain levels reduces the effective dielectric constant of Ga2O3:Ti film to less than that of SiO2, i.e. the inclusion of Ti turns the high-k gallium oxide dielectric into low-k insulator. The dielectric relaxation of the incorporated films was studied through the complex dielectric modulus M∗, from which the high-frequency dielectric constant ε∞′ and the most probable relaxation time (τ) as a function of Ti-inclusion level was determined. The optosensitivity of Ga2O3:Ti film was studied as a function of Ti inclusion. The temperature dependent of the dc-current leaks through Au/Ga2O3:Ti/Si, MOS arrangement predicts a red shift of the bandgap due to Ti doping.},

We determine the frequency dependence of 4 independent β−Ga2O3 Cartesian dielectric function tensor elements by matching large sets of experimental data using a point-by-point data inversion approach. From matching our monoclinic model to the obtained 4 dielectric function tensor components, we determine all infrared and far-infrared active transverse optic phonon modes with Au and Bu symmetry, and their eigenvectors within the monoclinic lattice. We find excellent agreement between our model results and results of density functional theory calculations. We derive and discuss the frequencies of longitudinal optical phonons in β−Ga2O3. We derive and report density and anisotropic mobility parameters of the free charge carriers within the tin-doped crystals. We discuss the occurrence of longitudinal phonon plasmon coupled modes in β−Ga2O3 and provide their frequencies and eigenvectors.

	abstract = {Carrier mobility extraction methods for graphene based on field-effect measurements are explored and compared according to theoretical analysis and experimental results. A group of graphene devices with different channel lengths were fabricated and measured, and carrier mobility is extracted from those electrical transfer curves using three different methods. Accuracy and applicability of those methods were compared. Transfer length method (TLM) can obtain accurate density dependent mobility and contact resistance at relative high carrier density based on data from a group of devices, and then can act as a standard method to verify other methods. As two of the most popular methods, direct transconductance method (DTM) and fitting method (FTM) can extract mobility easily based on transfer curve of a sole graphene device. DTM offers an underestimated mobility at any carrier density owing to the neglect of contact resistances, and the accuracy can be improved through fabricating field-effect transistors with long channel and good contacts. FTM assumes a constant mobility independent on carrier density, and then can obtain mobility, contact resistance and residual density stimulations through fitting a transfer curve. However, FTM tends to obtain a mobility value near Dirac point and then overestimates carrier mobility of graphene. Comparing with the DTM and FTM, TLM could offer a much more accurate and carrier density dependent mobility, that reflects the complete properties of graphene carrier mobility.},

For graphene, an ideal two-dimensional material, folding may transform it to complex shapes with new and distinct properties. Here, we present experimental results that folded structures in graphene, termed grafold, exist, and their formations can be controlled by introducing anisotropic surface curvature during graphene synthesis or transfer processes. Using pseudopotential-density-functional-theory calculations, we also show that double folding modifies the electronic band structure of graphene. Furthermore, we demonstrate the intercalation of C60 into the grafolds. Intercalation or functionalization of the chemically reactive folds further expands grafold's mechanical, chemical, optical, and electronic diversity.},

	abstract = {Spin Hall effects are a collection of relativistic spin-orbit coupling phenomena in which electrical currents can generate transverse spin currents and vice versa. Despite being observed only a decade ago, these effects are already ubiquitous within spintronics, as standard spin-current generators and detectors. Here the theoretical and experimental results that have established this subfield of spintronics are reviewed. The focus is on the results that have converged to give us the current understanding of the phenomena, which has evolved from a qualitative to a more quantitative measurement of spin currents and their associated spin accumulation. Within the experimental framework, optical-, transport-, and magnetization-dynamics-based measurements are reviewed and linked to both phenomenological and microscopic theories of the effect. Within the theoretical framework, the basic mechanisms in both the extrinsic and intrinsic regimes are reviewed, which are linked to the mechanisms present in their closely related phenomenon in ferromagnets, the anomalous Hall effect. Also reviewed is the connection to the phenomenological treatment based on spin-diffusion equations applicable to certain regimes, as well as the spin-pumping theory of spin generation used in many measurements of the spin Hall angle. A further connection to the spin-current-generating spin Hall effect to the inverse spin galvanic effect is given, in which an electrical current induces a nonequilibrium spin polarization. This effect often accompanies the spin Hall effect since they share common microscopic origins. Both can exhibit the same symmetries when present in structures comprising ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers through their induced current-driven spin torques or induced voltages. Although a short chronological overview of the evolution of the spin Hall effect field and the resolution of some early controversies is given, the main body of this review is structured from a pedagogical point of view, focusing on well-established and accepted physics. In such a young field, there remains much to be understood and explored, hence some of the future challenges and opportunities of this rapidly evolving area of spintronics are outlined.},

The objective of this paper is to review the available configurations and current status of the Hall effect-based technologies. A detailed discussion is carried out on the various types of existing Hall-based devices, such as linear sensors, field-programmable sensors, switches, latches, speed and directional sensors, and vane sensors. The effect of materials and the influence of several undesired effects (such as offset voltage, temperature, noise, and drift) are also investigated. The compensation/reduction techniques are mentioned therein, and interested researchers are encouraged for the development of new techniques. This paper concludes with the discussion on the market scenario (such as electronics sector and automotive industry) and progression in current research on Hall devices while projecting some new research directions in this field.},

Likewise, the discovered scale-invariant dissipationless conduction in these three quantum transport states has inspired us to the development of practical low-power-consumption electronics/spintronics applications. In this review article, we outline the fundamental physics and relations between different Hall effects. In general, QSHE is a result of band inversion due to the large spin-orbit coupling; since the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is well-protected in such QSH insulators, helical edge states with both spin-up and spin-down electrons are allowed and the conduction is immune to non-magnetic impurities. On the other hand, when TRS is broken by either perpendicular magnetic field or magnetic order, helical edge states are reduced to the single chiral channel, which in turn gives rise to QHE and QAHE, and backscattering from any impurity is strictly forbidden owing to the nature of chirality. Moreover, the interplay between this quantum Hall trio in certain conditions unveils new ways to explore emerging chiral materials and related quantum phenomena.},

Here, we observe a well-developed QHE arising from TSS in an intrinsic TI of BiSbTeSe2. Our samples exhibit surface-dominated conduction even close to room temperature, whereas the bulk conduction is negligible. At low temperatures and high magnetic fields perpendicular to the top and bottom surfaces, we observe well-developed integer quantized Hall plateaux, where the two parallel surfaces each contribute a half-integer e2/h quantized Hall conductance, accompanied by vanishing longitudinal resistance. When the bottom surface is gated to match the top surface in carrier density, only odd integer QH plateaux are observed, representing a half-integer QHE of two degenerate Dirac gases.

	abstract = {Shining light on a peculiar coupling
One of the long-standing predictions regarding topological insulators is the magnetoelectric effect, a coupling between a material's magnetic and electric properties. Thanks to this coupling, Maxwell's equations inside topological insulators are modified, resulting in so-called axion electrodynamics. Wu et al. used time-domain terahertz (THz) spectroscopy to observe signatures of these unusual electrodynamics in a thin film of Be2Se3. They detected tiny changes to the polarization of THz light after it passed through the thin film, confirming the expected quantization of the magnetoelectric coupling.
Science, this issue p. 1124
Topological insulators have been proposed to be best characterized as bulk magnetoelectric materials that show response functions quantized in terms of fundamental physical constants. Here, we lower the chemical potential of three-dimensional (3D) Bi2Se3 films to {\textasciitilde}30 meV above the Dirac point and probe their low-energy electrodynamic response in the presence of magnetic fields with high-precision time-domain terahertz polarimetry. For fields higher than 5 tesla, we observed quantized Faraday and Kerr rotations, whereas the dc transport is still semiclassical. A nontrivial Berry’s phase offset to these values gives evidence for axion electrodynamics and the topological magnetoelectric effect. The time structure used in these measurements allows a direct measure of the fine-structure constant based on a topological invariant of a solid-state system.
Time-domain terahertz polarimetry is used to measure the fine-structure constant in the solid state.

Small amplitude oscillatory shear rheology also showed that the shear modulus increased for aligned fibers. The structural changes were correlated to improvements in electric conductivity as probed by dielectric spectroscopy. XRD experiments performed with variable sample orientations also showed that the P3HT π–π stacking direction was aligned parallel to the direction of the fiber axis. Electric field alignment was also possible for other alkyl-thiophene polymers and for polymers with simple backbone repeat units.},

            The performance of semiconducting polymers has been steadily increasing in the last 20 years. Improved control over the microstructure of these materials and a deeper understanding of how the microstructure affects charge transport are partially responsible for such trend. The development and widespread use of techniques that allow to characterize the microstructure of semiconducting polymers is therefore instrumental for the advance of these materials. This article is a review of the characterization techniques that provide information used to enhance the understanding of structure/property relationships in semiconducting polymers. In particular, the applications of optical and X‐ray spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction, and scanning probe techniques in this context are described.},

Various characterization techniques are employed to probe bulk and surface microstructures, including polarized UV−vis absorption spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), and atomic force microscopy. While P(NDI2OD-T2) chains are found to be preferentially aligned parallel to the coating direction for an overall P(NDI2OD-T2) greater than 3 wt \%; below 3 wt \% P(NDI2OD-T2) a striking reversal of the preferential chain orientation from parallel to perpendicular to the coating direction is observed, captured by both bulk-sensitive (GIWAXS) and surface-sensitive (NEXAFS) techniques. Charge transport anisotropy is evaluated using top gate/bottom contact field-effect transistor measurements, from which higher charge-carrier mobility is achieved when P(NDI2OD-T2) chains are preferentially aligned with the channel length. Comparing the orientational order parameters extracted from the various techniques, the observed charge transport anisotropy trend most closely follows the degree of chain alignment at the surface obtained from NEXAFS spectroscopy. Overall our results indicate that the strong alignment can be achieved in P(NDI2OD-T2)/PS blends, with blending providing a route to modulate concentration effects in blade-coated films for the tuning and optimization of semiconductor chain alignment.},

A general formula for the index of refraction in terms of the atomic absorption coefficient α and the critical frequencies is given. From the condition, experimentally verified, that the electrons in the atom for impressed frequencies, large compared to their natural frequencies, shall act like free electrons as far as the index of refraction is concerned, a relation is obtained for α. From the failure of this relation when applied to the groups of electrons separately, conclusions are drawn as to the coupling of the groups. Some considerations on the origin of the Compton shifted radiation are added, from which it appears that in the wave description this radiation must be regarded as coming from all the atoms and as being coherent with the incident waves; a result suited to stress the difficulty of harmonizing the wave picture with that of quantum processes in the atoms.1},

Here we present a new non-fullerene acceptor that has been specifically designed to give improved performance alongside the wide bandgap donor poly(3-hexylthiophene), a polymer with significantly better prospects for commercial OPV due to its relative scalability and stability. Thanks to the well-matched optoelectronic and morphological properties of these materials, efficiencies of 6.4\% are achieved which is the highest reported for fullerene-free P3HT devices.

These studies reveal localized, template-directed partitioning of coexisting lamella- and cylinder-like subdomains at the template period length scale, manifesting as previously unknown morphologies such as aligned alternating subdomains, bilayers, or a “ladder” morphology.

              Precise determination of structural organization of semi-conducting polymers is of paramount importance for the further development of these materials in organic electronic technologies. Yet, prior characterization of some of the best-performing materials for transistor and photovoltaic applications, which are based on polymers with rigid backbones, often resulted in conundrums in which X-ray scattering and microscopy yielded seemingly contradicting results. Here we solve the paradox by introducing a new structural model,
              i.e.
              , semi-paracrystalline organization. The model establishes that the microstructure of these materials relies on a dense array of small paracrystalline domains embedded in a more disordered matrix. Thus, the overall structural order relies on two parameters: the novel concept of degree of paracrystallinity (
              i.e.
              , paracrystalline volume/mass fraction, introduced here for the first time) and the lattice distortion parameter of paracrystalline domains (
              g
              -parameter from X-ray scattering). Structural parameters of the model are correlated with long-range charge carrier transport, revealing that charge transport in semi-paracrystalline materials is particularly sensitive to the interconnection of paracrystalline domains.},

          , 
            
              Molecular packing and texture of semiconducting polymers are often critical to the performance of devices using these materials. Although frameworks exist to quantify the ordering, interpretations are often just qualitative, resulting in imprecise use of terminology. Here, we reemphasize the significance of quantifying molecular ordering in terms of degree of crystallinity (volume fractions that are ordered) and quality of ordering and their relation to the size scale of an ordered region. We are motivated in part by our own imprecise and inconsistent use of terminology in the past, as well as the need to have a primer or tutorial reference to teach new group members. We strive to develop and use consistent terminology with regards to crystallinity, semicrystallinity, paracrystallinity, and related characteristics. To account for vastly different quality of ordering along different directions, we classify paracrystals into 2D and 3D paracrystals and use paracrystallite to describe the spatial extent of molecular ordering in 1–10 nm. We show that a deeper understanding of molecular ordering can be achieved by combining grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering and differential scanning calorimetry, even though not all aspects of these measurements are consistent, and some classification appears to be method dependent. We classify a broad range of representative polymers under common processing conditions into five categories based on the quantitative analysis of the paracrystalline disorder parameter (
              g
              ) and thermal transitions. A small database is presented for 13 representative conjugated and insulating polymers ranging from amorphous to semi-paracrystalline. Finally, we outline the challenges to rationally design more perfect polymer crystals and propose a new molecular design approach that envisions conceptual molecular grafting that is akin to strained and unstrained hetero-epitaxy in classic (compound) semiconductors thin film growth.},

Conventional NR provides averaged information for an area larger than several square centimeters; therefore, it cannot be applied to an interface with an in-plane inhomogeneity. In this study, the NR imaging of the in-plane structure of polymer thin films was achieved. The tomographic reconstruction of the spatially resolved NR profiles obtained by a sheet-shaped neutron beam provided a two-dimensional image of the in-plane interface morphology. The depth distribution of the neutron scattering length density was obtained by analyzing the position-dependent NR profile at a local area less than 0.1 mm2. The current NR tomography method enables NR measurements for an interface with an inhomogeneous structure. It also provides information on the three-dimensional distribution of the atomic composition near the surface and interfaces for various materials.},

As many of these applications are highly specific, in that substitutes for the REE are inferior or unknown, the REE have acquired a level of technological significance much greater than expected from their relative obscurity. Although actually more abundant than many familiar industrial metals, the REE have much less tendency to become concentrated in exploitable ore deposits. Consequently, most of the world’s supply comes from only a few sources. The United States once was largely self-sufficient in REE, but in the past decade has become dependent upon imports from China.},

	abstract = {Conventional organic optoelectronic devices suffer from low carrier mobility limited by the static and dynamic disorder. Organic crystals with long-range order can circumvent the effects of disorder and significantly improve the charge transport. While highly ordered organic crystals offer the desirable electronic coupling strength and charge transport, their integration into large-area optoelectronic devices remains a challenge. Here, monolithic integrated triclinic crystal rubrene light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are presented using epitaxial growth with functional additives being engineered into the films. Superior charge transport, excellent operational and long-term stability in these light-emitting devices are demonstrated. By comparing two rubrene-based LEDs, one made from amorphous and one from crystalline rubrene layers, their exciton dynamics are estimated using comprehensive transient electroluminescence simulation. The crystalline LEDs show high triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) rate constant similar to TTA rate constant of triclinic single crystals determined by optical spectroscopy. At the same time, the crystalline phase enhances drastically the singlet-fission and bimolecular annihilation rates, which reduces the overall performance of the LED compared to its amorphous counterpart. Finally, an outlook on the potential applications of rubrene and/or its derivatives crystalline films are provided for enhancing the performance of organic and hybrid optoelectronic devices.},

	abstract = {For obtaining reliable nanostructural details of large amounts of sample—and if it is applicable—small-angle scattering (SAS) is a prime technique to use. It promises to obtain bulk-scale, statistically sound information on the morphological details of the nanostructure, and has thus led to many a researcher investing their time in it over the last eight decades of development. Due to pressure from scientists requesting more details on increasingly complex nanostructures, as well as the ever improving instrumentation leaving less margin for ambiguity, small-angle scattering methodologies have been evolving at a high pace over the past few decades. As the quality of any results can only be as good as the data that go into these methodologies, the improvements in data collection and all imaginable data correction steps are reviewed here. This work is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of all data corrections, to aid the small-angle scatterer to decide which are relevant for their measurement and how these corrections are performed. Clear mathematical descriptions of the corrections are provided where feasible. Furthermore, as no quality data exist without a decent estimate of their precision, the error estimation and propagation through all these steps are provided alongside the corrections. With these data corrections, the collected small-angle scattering pattern can be made of the highest standard, allowing for authoritative nanostructural characterization through its analysis. A brief background of small-angle scattering, the instrumentation developments over the years, and pitfalls that may be encountered upon data interpretation are provided as well.},

It joins together small-angle X-ray scattering (a statistical nanoprobe) with X-ray spectroscopy that brings with it unique chemical and bond-orientation sensitivity. Through over a decade of discovery and development, RSoXS is moving from a niche technique applied to organic electronic thin films to a mature tool applicable to a plethora of polymeric and molecular systems, encompassing new modalities, analyses, and simulation methods. This development promises to deliver increasingly quantitative answers to challenging questions in polymer science as well as expand its usefulness to complementary fields. This review presents a full synopsis of the technique, including background on the theoretical underpinnings, measurement best practices, and examples of recent RSoXS applications and discoveries provided here to accelerate the transition to a broader range of soft matter and polymeric fields.},

In particular, this diffractive X-ray waveguiding reveals a self-organized 5 nm thick crystalline surface layer with crystalline orientation orthogonal to the underlying 65 nm thick layer. While demonstrated for an organic semiconductor film, this approach is applicable to any thin film material system with stratified crystalline structure where orientation can influence important interfacial processes such as charge injection and field-effect transport.},

This enabled quantitative phantom imaging experiments on a clinical computed tomography (CT) scanner, which showed that the coordination polymers possessed strong CT contrast properties.

	abstract = {The primary interactions of low-energy x-rays within condensed matter, viz. photoabsorption and coherent scattering, have been described for photon energies outside the absorption threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.},

            The way in which conjugated polymers pack in the solid state strongly affects the performance of polymer-based optoelectronic devices. However, even for the most crystalline conjugated polymers the precise packing of chains within the unit cell is not well established. Here we show that by performing resonant X-ray diffraction experiments at the sulfur K-edge we are able to resolve the tilting of the planar backbones of crystalline poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) within the unit cell. This approach exploits the anisotropic nature of the X-ray optical properties of conjugated polymers, enabling us to discern between different proposed crystal structures. By comparing our data with simulations based on different orientations, a tilting of the planar conjugated backbone with respect to the side chain stacking direction of 30 ± 5° is determined.},

As well as possessing crystalline order on the molecular scale, P3HT also exhibits regular ordering of crystalline lamellae on the nanoscale. This layering of crystalline and amorphous regions is characterized by the so-called “long period” which can be measured with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The weak scattering contrast between amorphous and crystalline phases generally requires SAXS measurement of bulk powder samples. Here, we show that by utilizing polarized tender X-rays tuned to the sulfur K-edge, strong contrast between amorphous and crystalline phases can be generated allowing for the long period of thin ﬁlm P3HT samples to be easily observed. Furthermore, we show that the contrast generated results from diﬀerences in orientational order in the amorphous and crystalline regions.
