# Introduction
A LaTeX repository of an introduction to the microstructure of organic semiconductors. 
This library particularly is created to summarise what we know about organic semiconductors, the relevant measurement techniques such as grasing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), and charged transport.
